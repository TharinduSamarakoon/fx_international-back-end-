54,fxstreet,0,2022-05-25,NZD/USD flat on the day in the 0.6460s pre-Fed minutes releases after hawkish RBNZ-induced volatility,nzd/usd gyrated with a 100 pip 0.6410-0.6510ish range on wednesday initially boosted following a 50 bps rate hike and hawkish rate guidance from the rbnz during asia pacific trade only to be knocked back from highs amid a rebound from monthly lows in the us dollar. at current levels the pair is trading flat on the day in the 0.6460s though holds on to gains on the week of about 1.0.to recap the recent rbnz meeting the bank raised interest rates from 1.5 to 2.0 as expected but delivered much more hawkish rate guidance than forecast predicting rates would end the year at 3.4 and rise as high as 3.95 by next september. that was a big jump from the bank’s previous forecast that rates would reach 2.2 by the end of this year and 3.4 by next september.rbnz governor adrian orr’s commentary was suitably hawkish. he pledged that the committee would continue raising interest rates until they reach a level where the bank is confident that inflationary pressures will be brought under control after which rates might then be able to fall back a little. for what it's worth economic consultancy capital economics said on wednesday that they think the rbnz’s aggressive tightening cycle will tip the new zealand housing market into a downturn and the rbnz will end up cutting rates by the middle of 2023.back to wednesday’s price action dip-buying has been attributed as behind the us dollar’s comeback on wednesday after the dxy hit its lowest levels in nearly a month on tuesday under 102.00. however the buck has been knocked back a touch from earlier highs in wake of weaker-than-expected us durable goods orders data for april. analysts said the data showed a moderation of business investment at the start of q2 probably as a result of hawkish fed-induced tighter financial conditions.  speaking of which the main drivers for nzd/usd for the rest of the session will be remarks from fed vice chair lael brainard from 1615 gmt and then the release of the minutes from this month’s fed meeting at 1800 gmt. the minutes are expected to show strong support on the fomc for fed chair jerome powell’s plans to lift rates expeditiously to neutral by the end of this year with traders likely most interest in any difference of opinion on what should come next.should the fed pause and reassess or continue hiking interest rates in order to tame inflation? any preference towards the latter could see the buck supported which might send nzd/usd back to the lower 0.6400s where bears would then eye a test of the 21-day moving average in the 0.6390s just below it.  ,"['nzd/usd', 'flat', 'day', '0.6460s', 'pre-fed', 'minutes', 'release', 'hawkish', 'rbnz-induced', 'volatility']",na,nzd/usd,oneday_counter

193,fxstreet,8,2022-05-24,Gold Price Analysis XAU/USD remains underpinned near $1860 as buck equities falter yields remain subdued,spot gold xau/usd is unsurprisingly trading with an upside bias just above its 21-day moving average at $1856.70 and near the $1860 mark amid a favourable macro backdrop that sees long-term us yields hovering close to monthly lows us equities reversing monday’s gains in pre-market trade and the dxy falling to fresh four-week lows under 102. the precious metal was last trading with gains of about 0.2 boosted amid safe-haven flows from equities by falling yields lowering the “opportunity cost” of holding non-yielding assets like gold and as a the weaker us dollar makes the purchase of usd-denominated commodities like gold cheaper for international buyers thus boosting its demand.focus turns to upcoming us flash pmi survey data for may scheduled for release at 1345gmt as investors fret about the strength of the us economy. recent indications from major us companies most recently snap’s guidance on monday but before that from major retailers last week is that conditions are worsening though other indicators haven't been quite so downbeat. tuesday’s pmis are expected to fall in the latter camp but traders should monitor the data in case it triggers any cross-asset volatility.thereafter fed chair jerome powell is scheduled to deliver some pre-recorded remarks at an event from 1620gmt. there is much less confusion/uncertainty about the fed than there is about the current strength of the us economy. they are unequivocally hawkish with powell last week reiterating the bank’s desire to get rates to neutral by the end of the year meaning a few more 50 bps hikes at upcoming meetings and saying the bank wouldn’t hesitate to raise rates beyond neutral if needed to tame inflation which remains far too high. other fed policymakers have all been reading off of the same script and the takeaway is clear interest rates are moving higher.the big question for markets is just how much higher. gold traders should beware that while the us dollar’s recent pullback from multi-decade highs printed earlier in the month has given the precious metal some short-term respite its currently more than $50 higher versus earlier monthly lows this may prove short-lived if inflation fails to moderate as fast as the fed wants in the coming months and if markets subsequently start betting on a higher fed terminal rate. this would push long-term yields and the us dollar higher which would make a return to sub-$1800 levels likely.  ,"['gold', 'price', 'analysis', 'xau/usd', 'remain', 'underpin', 'near', '$', '1860', 'buck', 'equities', 'falter', 'yield', 'remain', 'subdue']",na,[],fivemin_counter
194,fxstreet,8,2022-05-24,EUR/USD pushes above 1.0700 amid hawkish ECB vibes despite soft EZ PMIs focus turns to US data/Fed’s Powell,weaker than forecast eurozone flash pmi survey data for may has not deterred euro bulls on tuesday given that it unlike the uk data still indicated solid underlying growth despite continued high inflationary pressures. indeed eur/usd has been able to reclaim the 1.0700 level with the pair getting tailwinds from hawkish ecb commentary thus far on the week. at current levels between 1.0710-20 the pair is trading with gains of about 0.25 on the day taking its gains on the week to around 1.5.to recap in a monday blog post ecb president christine lagarde said that the ecb would likely lift interest rates into positive territory by the end of q3 a stance she reiterated in remarks made earlier this tuesday. other important ecb players have thrown support behind this shift in stance including bank of france head francois villeroy de galhau though a few of the ecb’s more hawkish members have been reportedly irked by the fact that lagarde and other “core” ecb members have taken a 50 bps rate rise off of the table. austria’s robert holzmann was on tuesday pushing for a 50 bps hike in july.even if the hawks aren’t satisfied the euro bulls seem to be. eur/usd is nearly 3.5 higher versus lows printed earlier in the month in the mid-1.0300s defying for now calls by some analysts for eur/usd to hit parity in the weeks/months ahead. the recent upturn in the pair also comes despite continued ropey sentiment in the global equity space which would normally be a headwind given likely usd safe-haven flows.eur/usd is now eyeing a test of its 50-day moving average in the 1.0760s and strategists are unsurprisingly questioning how much further the rebound has to run. the major driver of usd gains thus far this year has been the hawkish shift from the fed and commentary from policymakers last week suggested that they are only getting more hawkish. fed chair jerome powell is slated to speak at 1620 gmt on tuesday and will likely reiterate the bank’s stance that it is ready to lift interest rates above neutral without hesitation if needed to tame inflation.that is a far more hawkish stance than that of the ecb and as a result fx strategists suspect it won’t be long before the usd bulls return to buy the dip which likely caps the prospect of a prolonged eur/usd rebound. focus will also be on the upcoming release of us flash pmi survey data for may at 1345 gmt which should show growth in the us remains solid and inflationary pressures high.  ,"['eur/usd', 'push', '1.0700', 'amid', 'hawkish', 'ecb', 'vibes', 'despite', 'soft', 'ez', 'pmis', 'focus', 'turn', 'us', 'data/fed', '’', 'powell']",na,eur/usd,fivemin_counter
195,fxstreet,8,2022-05-24,USD/CAD pares intraday gains back below 1.2800 mark amid weaker USD/uptick in oil prices,the usd/cad pair struggled to capitalize on its goodish bounce from a near three-week low set earlier this tuesday and was seen trading below the 1.2800 mark heading into the north american session.the impending european union ban on russian oil imports continued fueling concerns about tightening global supply. adding to this hopes for demand recovery in china assisted crude oil prices to reverse modest intraday losses. this in turn underpinned the commodity-linked loonie and acted as a headwind for the usd/cad pair amid the emergence of fresh selling around the us dollar.in fact the key usd index dropped to a nearly one-month low amid strong pickup in the shared currency which gained traction in reaction to hawkish comments by the european central bank ecb policymakers. that said the prevalent risk-off environment amid the worsening global economic outlook helped limit losses for the safe-haven buck and extended some support to the usd/cad pair.investors remain worried that a more aggressive move by major central banks to curb soaring inflation could pose challenges to the global economy. adding to this the russia-ukraine war and the latest covid-19 outbreak in china have been fueling recession fears. this in turn kept a lid on the overnight optimistic move in the markets and benefitted traditional safe-haven assets.apart from this expectations that the us central bank would need to take more drastic action to bring inflation under control held back traders from placing aggressive usd bearish bets. hence the focus will remain glued to fed chair jerome powell's speech later during the early north american session and the latest fomc meeting minutes scheduled for release on wednesday.a 50 bps fed rate hike move over the next two meetings is already priced in suggesting that market participants will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo 75 bps rate hike in june. this in turn will play a key role in driving the usd demand in the near term and assist traders to determine the next leg of a directional move for the usd/cad pair.in the meantime traders will take cues from the us economic docket featuring the releases of the flash pmi prints for may new home sales and richmond manufacturing index. this along with the broader market risk sentiment will drive the usd demand. apart from this oil price dynamics should allow traders to grab short-term opportunities around the usd/cad pair.  ,"['usd/cad', 'par', 'intraday', 'gain', 'back', '1.2800', 'mark', 'amid', 'weaker', 'usd/uptick', 'oil', 'price']",na,usd/cad,fivemin_counter
