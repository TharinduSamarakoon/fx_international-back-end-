0,2022-05-25,Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD slumps towards $1840s as traders book profits ahead of FOMC minutes,"Gold spot (XAU/USD) slides below the 20-day moving average (DMA) and accelerates towards the 200-DMA at $1839.66 on Wednesday, courtesy of a positive market mood. At the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading at $1844.98, down 1.10%.On Wednesday, the non-yielding metal, alongside other precious metals, falls as the greenback remains buoyant and jumps from weekly lows. The US Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s value, is gaining 0.52%, currently at 102.300. Meanwhile, the US 10-year treasury yield is almost flat in the day, stationary at 2.752%, as market players wait for the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee May minutes.Sentiment-wise, market players shrugged off concerns that the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle could cause a recession. Global equities are recording solid gains. Meanwhile, money market futures showed that investors are scaling back their bets on the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) for 2023, widely expected to finish around 3%, to just above the 2.50% threshold.On Tuesday, the Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that the Fed might pause its tightening cycle once hiking rates to the 2% threshold so the central bank can witness how the economy behaves.Before Wall Street opened, the US economic docket unveiled housing data, which came mixed but tilted positively, albeit concerns that the US economy might hit a recession. At the same time, the Durable Goods Orders for April grew steadily but missed expectations. At around 18:00 GMT, the Federal Reserve would unveil its May minutes, giving traders additional clues regarding the US central bank monetary policy plans.In the week ahead, the US docket would feature GDP Estimate figures, Initial Jobless Claims, Pending Home Sales, and the Fed’s favorite measurement for inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE).On Wednesday, the XAU/USD remains downward pressured, tumbling below the 20-DMA and also threatening to slide beneath the trend-setter 200-DMA at $1839.66. It appears that Gold’s pullback could be some profit-taking ahead of the release of the FOMC minutes. However, any further hawkish reinforcement by the Fed’s minutes could send the yellow metal towards the aforementioned 200-DMA and beyond, targeting May lows around $1786.50.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,GBP/USD bounces from weekly lows and marches firmly above 1.2530s pre-FOMC minutes,"The British pound recovers some ground on Wednesday during the North American session, bouncing near weekly lows around 1.2480s and back above the 1.2500 figure. At 1.2545, the GBP/USD grinds higher due to an improved market mood.Invertors’ shrugged off Federal Reserve concerns that aggressive tightening might cause a recession. On Tuesday, Atlanta’s Fed President Raphael Bostic, who leans towards the hawkish end of the spectrum, sounded dovish, saying that the US central bank might pause its tightening cycle once rates hit the 2% threshold so the central bank can witness how the economy behaves.Meanwhile, global equities pare some of their weekly losses, reflecting the upbeat move while the greenback rises. The US Dollar Index, a measurement of the buck’s value against a basket of six currencies, reclaims the 102.000 mark, gaining 0.40%, putting a lid on the GBP/USD rally. The US 10-year Treasury yield remains flat around the 2.752% mark.The US economic docket featured housing data, which came in mixed but tilted positively, despite concerns about the US's growing economic outlook. Later, April’s Durable Goods Orders grew at a slower pace than foreseen but kept positive. At around 18:00 GMT, the Federal Reserve will unveil its May minutes, giving traders additional clues regarding the US central bank monetary policy plans.In the meantime, the Atlanta Fed GDP Now, the projection of US GDP for the second quarter, rose to 1.8%, lower than the previous reading, which came in at 2.1%.An absent UK docket leaves GBP/USD traders adrift to BoE-speak led by its Chief Economist Huw Pill. Earlier, Pill said that too much tightening runs the risk of getting stuck in a deep recession, but too little tightening runs the risk of inflation gaining self-sustaining momentum. Pill's remarks came a day after a raft of downbeat UK PMI data, which reignited fears about a UK economic slowdown, threatening to keep the central bank from further tightening monetary conditions.The GBP/USD is downward biased, albeit recovering some ground. Nevertheless, a solid resistance area looms at the May 4 daily highs near 1.2638, a resistance just shy of a four-month-old downsloping trendline that passes above 1.2700. That ceiling area would be difficult to overcome for GBP/USD bulls, but once cleared, a re-test of the 1.3000 area is on the cards. Otherwise, a break below 1.2470 would expose the major to further selling pressure that could send the pair for a re-test of the YTD lows at around 1.2155.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,NZD/USD flat on the day in the 0.6460s pre-Fed minutes releases after hawkish RBNZ-induced volatility,"NZD/USD gyrated with a 100 pip, 0.6410-0.6510ish range on Wednesday, initially boosted following a 50 bps rate hike and hawkish rate guidance from the RBNZ during Asia Pacific trade, only to be knocked back from highs amid a rebound from monthly lows in the US dollar. At current levels, the pair is trading flat on the day in the 0.6460s, though holds on to gains on the week of about 1.0%.To recap the recent RBNZ meeting, the bank raised interest rates from 1.5% to 2.0% as expected, but delivered much more hawkish rate guidance than forecast, predicting rates would end the year at 3.4% and rise as high as 3.95% by next September. That was a big jump from the bank’s previous forecast that rates would reach 2.2% by the end of this year and 3.4% by next September.RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr’s commentary was suitably hawkish. He pledged that the committee would continue raising interest rates until they reach a level where the bank is confident that inflationary pressures will be brought under control, after which rates might then be able to fall back a little. For what it's worth, economic consultancy Capital Economics said on Wednesday that they think the RBNZ’s aggressive tightening cycle will tip the New Zealand housing market into a downturn, and the RBNZ will end up cutting rates by the middle of 2023.Back to Wednesday’s price action; dip-buying has been attributed as behind the US dollar’s comeback on Wednesday after the DXY hit its lowest levels in nearly a month on Tuesday under 102.00. However, the buck has been knocked back a touch from earlier highs in wake of weaker-than-expected US Durable Goods Orders data for April. Analysts said the data showed a moderation of business investment at the start of Q2 probably as a result of hawkish Fed-induced tighter financial conditions.  Speaking of which, the main drivers for NZD/USD for the rest of the session will be remarks from Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard from 16:15 GMT and then the release of the minutes from this month’s Fed meeting at 18:00 GMT. The minutes are expected to show strong support on the FOMC for Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s plans to lift rates expeditiously to neutral by the end of this year, with traders likely most interest in any difference of opinion on what should come next.Should the Fed pause and reassess, or continue hiking interest rates in order to tame inflation? Any preference towards the latter could see the buck supported, which might send NZD/USD back to the lower 0.6400s, where bears would then eye a test of the 21-Day Moving Average in the 0.6390s just below it.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,Silver Price Analysis: XAG/USD remains under $22.00 level pre-Fed minutes releases as 21DMA caps upside,"Spot silver (XAG/USD) prices were last trading just the south of the $22.00 level per troy ounce, with the 21-Day Moving Average at $22.04 still offering decent resistance and the precious metals also weighed amid a bounce from monthly lows in the US dollar in the run-up to the release of the minutes of this month’s FOMC meeting. Weaker than expected US Durable Goods Orders data for April, which showed a moderation of business investment at the start of Q2 probably as a result of hawkish Fed-induced tighter financial conditions, has helped XAG/USD recover from earlier session lows in the $21.70s, but silver still trades lower by about 0.7% on the day.The impact of tighter financial conditions was also evident in housing figures released on Tuesday that showed a steep drop in US New Home Sales in April. However, the biggest factor seemingly holding back economic activity in the US economy remains the sharp rise in inflation since the start of 2021. So long as inflation remains elevated, the US central bank may be forced to look through economic weakness. Traders will be closely scrutinising the upcoming minutes release for any commentary on how the Fed views the trade-off between weaker growth and elevated inflation.The minutes are expected to show that FOMC members stand firmly behind Chairman Jerome Powell’s plan to lift interest rates “expeditiously” back to neutral by the end of the year. Any debate over whether the Fed should then pause and assess, or continue lifting rates well into restrictive territory would be interesting. Preference for the latter (which would be hawkish) could well see the USD and US yields catch a bid, and this could weigh on silver.Indeed, silver’s failure to rally above its 21DMA is a sign that recent bullish momentum since the middle of the month that has seen XAG/USD bounce from the mid-$20.00s has started to fade. Traders will also be watching remarks from Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard from 1615GMT, who is likely to stick to the Fed’s script. Silver bears will be hoping that hawkish vibes return and send XAG/USD back to monthly lows in the mid-$20.00s.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,"USD/CHF clings to gains amid stronger USD, lacks follow-through ahead of FOMC minutes","USD/CHF staged modest recovery from a one-month low amid resurgent USD demand.The risk-off mood underpinned the safe-haven CHF and kept a lid on any further gains.Investors look forward to the FOMC meeting minutes for a fresh directional impetus.The USD/CHF pair held on to its modest gains through the early North American session and was last seen trading just a few pips below the daily high, around the 0.9620-0.9625 region.The US dollar made a solid comeback and snapped a two-day losing streak to a nearly one-month low, which, in turn, assisted the USD/CHF pair to attract some buying on Wednesday. Repositioning trade ahead of the FOMC minutes turned out to be a key factor that prompted short-covering around the USD, which seemed unaffected by softer-than-expected US Durable Goods Orders data.That said, the prevalent risk-off environment extended some support to the safe-haven Swiss franc and kept a lid on any meaningful upside for the USD/CHF pair. Investors remain worried that a more aggressive move by major central banks to constrain inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China would pose challenges to the global economy.The worsening global economic outlook continued weighing on investors' sentiment, which was evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. The anti-risk flow was reinforced by declining US Treasury bond yields. This might further hold back the USD bulls from placing aggressive bets and cap gains for the USD/CHF pair ahead of the key event risk.Given that a 50 bps Fed rate hike move is fully priced in, market participants will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo 75 bps rate hike in June. This will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to the USD/CHF pair.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,EUR/USD: The sell-off runs out of steam in the 1.0640 region,"The sentiment around the single currency remains sour and prompts EUR/USD to keep the trade well south of the 1.0700 yardstick on Wednesday.EUR/USD corrects lower following a failed attempt to extend the daily range further north of the 1.0750 zone, sparking a subsequent correction of nearly one big figure to the vicinity of 1.0640.The renewed strength in the dollar sponsored the move lower in spot, which it has also met some help from lower yields on both sides of the ocean.No news from earlier comments from ECB-speakers, as practically all of them joined the summer rate hike narrative in place in the last couple of weeks.In the euro calendar, earlier results saw the German GDP Growth Rate expand 3.8% YoY in Q1 and the Consumer Confidence tracked by GfK improved marginally to -26 for the month of June. In France, the Consumer Confidence came in short of expectations in May at 86 (from April’s 87).Across the pond, MBA’s Mortgage Applications contracted 1.2% in the week to May 20 and headline Durable Goods Orders came in short of expectations after expanding 0.4% MoM in April.Next on tap will be the publication of the FOMC Minutes of the May meeting.The moderate rebound in the dollar puts the recent sharp upside in EUR/USD to the test, sparking a marked drop to the 1.0640 region so far.Despite the pair’s recent upside impulse, the broader outlook for the single currency remains in the negative territory for the time being. As usual, price action in spot should reflect dollar dynamics, geopolitical concerns and the Fed-ECB divergence.Occasional pockets of strength in the single currency, however, should appear reinforced by speculation the ECB could raise rates at some point in the summer, while higher German yields, elevated inflation and a decent pace of the economic recovery in the region are also supportive of an improvement in the mood around the euro.Key events in the euro area this week: Germany Final Q1 GDP, GfK Consumer Confidence, ECB Lagarde (Wednesday).Eminent issues on the back boiler: Speculation of the start of the hiking cycle by the ECB as soon as this summer. Asymmetric economic recovery post-pandemic in the euro area. Impact of the war in Ukraine on the region’s growth prospects.So far, spot is losing 0.60 at 1.0667 and a breach of 1.0459 (low May 18) would target 1.0348 (2022 low May 13) en route to 1.0340 (2017 low January 3 2017). On the other hand, the next up barrier aligns at 1.0748 (monthly high May 24) followed by 1.0779 (55-day SMA) and finally 1.0936 (weekly high April 21). ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,WTI continues to move sideways near $110 with focus on rising US demand as peak driving season nears,"Amid a subdued tone to macro trading conditions with markets in wait and see mode ahead of commentary from Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard and the release of the minutes of this month’s Fed meeting, and amid a lack of any notable fundamental catalysts to spur volatility, oil prices are going sideways. Front-month WTI futures were last trading just to the north of $110, having spent the last three sessions pivoting either side of this level. That leaves prices around the midpoint of recent $105-$110 ranges.Market commentators continue to cite expectations for rising fuel demand in key markets (like the US) as peak driving season approaches as supportive of prices. Weekly US inventory data coming up at 1430GMT is expected to show another approximately 640K barrel drop in gasoline inventories following last week’s 4.8M barrel drop. That would mean that gasoline inventories have only in one week out of the 16 weeks since early February.“Just ahead of the summer driving season, U.S. gasoline stocks find themselves at their seasonally lowest level since 2014,” analysts at Commerzbank said on Wednesday. That drop in US gasoline inventories goes hand in hand with the recent sharp rise in US gasoline prices and reflects increasingly tight global market conditions as OPEC nations lift output only very slowly, and as Russian oil production struggles in the face of tough sanctions on the country following its invasion of Ukraine.Those sanctions on Russia look set to tighten in the weeks ahead. The EU hopes to agree on a plan to embargo Russian oil imports over the course of the next few months ahead of next week’s EU Council Summit meeting, EU Council President Charles Michel said on Wednesday. The US has already banned all Russian imports, while the UK will end imports by the end of the year. As a result, many global oil buyers have been “self-sanctioning” (i.e. avoiding Russian oil even in the absence of sanctions) out of fear that new sanctions may come.A Reuters report on Wednesday said that Russian oil stored in vessels at seas has hit a record high as the nation struggles to find buyers. Russian oil output is expected to have dropped by as much as 3M barrels per day as of this month versus the country’s pre-invasion of Ukraine levels.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,EUR/CAD to push towards 1.39/1.40 on a clear break above 1.3755 – Scotiabank,"EUR/CAD pressures key resistance in the mid-1.37s. A break above the latter would open up additional gains toward the 1.39/1.40 area, economists at Scotiabank report.“EUR/CAD price action reflects a clear reduction in bearish technical pressure. The EUR is nearing the mid-1.37 zone that has served as a cap on the market since early April; a break above this point – on a consistent basis – is needed to really signal a change in tone for the cross.”“We think a clear break above 1.3755 targets a push to 1.39/1.40.” ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,USD/CAD to slide back to the low 1.27 zone – Scotiabank,"USD/CAD retains a soft technical undertone. Economists at Scotiabank target low 1.27s.“We are focusing on the potential for the USD to slide back to the low 1.27 zone (1.2715 as the early May low and 1.2740 as the next Fibonacci retracement support) as a short-term objective. Below here and losses can be expected to extend to the 1.25/1.26 zone in the next few weeks, given the strength of the USD turn lower from the recent peaks.”“We look for USD losses to pick up some momentum below short-term support at 1.2765.” “We think minor USD gains through the low 1.28s are liable to draw out firm selling pressure.”  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,"USD/CAD eases from multi-day peak, still well bid above mid-1.2800s ahead of FOMC minutes","The USD/CAD pair built on the previous day's modest bounce from over a two-week low, around the 1.2760 area and gained traction for the second successive day on Wednesday. The momentum pushed spot prices to a fresh weekly high, around the 1.2885 region during the early North American session and was sponsored by broad-based US dollar strength.The worsening outlook for the global economy continued weighing on investors' sentiment, which was evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. This allowed the safe-haven USD to stage a solid recovery from the monthly low touched on Tuesday. Apart from this, some repositioning trade ahead of the key event risk on Wednesday prompted some USD short-covering and turned out to be a key factor that extended support to the USD/CAD pair.The anti-risk flow, along with the idea that the Fed could pause the rate hike cycle later this year, dragged the US Treasury bond yields to the lowest level in over a month. This, however, did little to dent the strong intraday bullish sentiment surrounding the USD, which also seemed rather unaffected by weaker US Durable Goods Orders data. That said, an uptick in crude oil prices could underpin the commodity-linked loonie and cap the USD/CAD pair.Investors might also be reluctant to place aggressive bets and prefer to wait for a fresh catalyst from the FOMC meeting minutes, due for release later during the US session. Market participants will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo 75 bps Fed rate hike in June. This, in turn, will play a key role in driving the USD demand. Apart from this, crude oil price dynamics should produce short-term trading opportunities around the USD/CAD pair.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,Brent Oil to tank towards $95 by year-end – Commerzbank,"Oil prices have calmed down after the sharp rise at the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Strategists at Commerzbank expect the price of Brent oil to fall to $95 per barrel by the end of the year.“We expect that the price of Brent oil will continue to fluctuate between $100 and 115 per barrel in the current quarter, before falling in the second half of the year.”“By the end of the year, Brent should be trading at $95. This is based on the assumption that there will be an EU oil embargo on Russian oil. This would increase demand for non-Russian oil, which would also have a price-increasing effect and thus justify a somewhat higher oil price level in the second half of the year than we have expected so far.”",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,"USD/JPY sticks to gains near 127.00 amid stronger USD, FOMC minutes awaited","The USD/JPY pair surrendered its modest intraday gains and was last seen hovering near the lower end of the daily trading range, just below the 127.00 mark during the early North American session.The market sentiment remains fragile amid growing concerns about softening global economic growth amid the prospects for a more aggressive move by major central banks to constrain inflation. Furthermore, the Russia-Ukraine war and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China have been fueling recession fears, which continued weighing on investors' sentiment. This, in turn, extended some support to the safe-haven Japanese yen and acted as a headwind for the USD/JPY pair.The global flight to safety, along with the idea that the Fed could pause the rate hike cycle later this year, dragged the US Treasury bond yields to the lowest level in over a month. This was seen as another factor that inspired bearish traders and kept a lid on the USD/JPY pair's early uptick. The downside, however, remains cushioned amid strong pickup in demand for the US dollar, which seemed rather unaffected by disappointing US Durable Goods Orders data.The markets reacted little to the US macro release as the focus remains glued to the latest FOMC monetary policy meeting minutes, due for release later during the US session. Given that a 50 bps rate hike at the next two meetings is fully priced in, investors will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo 75 bps in June. This will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and help determine the next leg of a directional move for the USD/JPY pair.  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,"Gold Price Analysis: XAU/USD slides back to mid-$1850s, eyes 200DMA pre-Fed minutes","Though weaker than expected just-released US Durable Goods Orders data for April saw long-term US yields hit fresh monthly lows, a reflection of rising concerns about the current health of the US economy, this has not been enough to lift gold back into positive territory on the day. XAU/USD continues to trade with losses of more than 0.5% on the day in the mid-$1850s, weighed as the US dollar clings onto gains ahead of upcoming remarks from Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard and the release of the May Fed meeting minutes later in the day.The US dollar has been weakening over the last few sessions, with the DXY pulling back from annual highs above 105.00 to current levels in the mid-102.00s, a reflection of position adjustment following a period of prolonged US dollar outperformance as well as recent downside in long-term US yields. This has facilitated a bounce in gold from sub-$1800 levels to the $1850s.But the message from Fed policymakers in recent weeks has remained resolutely hawkish. The debate right now is over whether the Fed will be able to pause interest rate hikes when it gets to neutral and the extent to which it might need to raise interest rates beyond neutral. The debate is not over the need to tighten rates back to neutral levels, implying the bank is on autopilot for plenty more tightening this year, including two 50 bps moves at the next two meetings.As a result, many strategists suspect that recent USD weakness will likely prove short-lived, suggesting XAU/USD may not be able to sustain itself at mid-$1800 levels for long. If today’s Fed speak/minutes trigger a hawkish market reaction, traders should look out for gold retesting its 200-Day Moving Average around the $1840 levels.   ",fxstreet

The more widely followed Core Durable Goods Orders metric rose 0.3% MoM, also below expectations for a 0.6% rise and down from March's 1.1% MoM growth rate, which had been revised lower from 1.2%. The US dollar has experienced some minor weakness in wake of the downbeat data, with the DXY dropping back from session highs in the 102.40s to the 102.30s, as US 10-year yields probe 2.70%, their lowest levels in more than one month.    ",fxstreet

That said, the next up barrier now appears at the 55-day SMA, today at 1.0787 ahead of the 3-month resistance line around 1.0830.The breakout of this area should mitigate the selling pressure and allow for a probable move to the weekly high at 1.0936 (April 21).The daily RSI around 51 also indicates that extra upside could still be in store for the pair until it reaches the overbought territory (>70).  ",fxstreet
0,2022-05-25,EUR/USD to move back towards the 1.03 area in the coming months – Rabobank,"In the view of economists at Rabobank, slowing global growth is likely to leave the USD well supported. Subsequently, the EUR/USD pair is set to edge lower towards the 1.03 zone in the coming months.“Despite the recent move higher in EUR/USD, we continue to see risk of another attempt at the downside on a 1 to 3 month view.” “In addition to concerns about slowing growth risks in the US and in Europe, Chinese growth is also vulnerable. On the back of the country’s commitment to its zero Covid policy, forecasters have been consistently revising down growth expectations for China in recent months.”“Global growth risks suggest that demand for safe-haven assets is likely to remain on the front foot. This suggests the likelihood of a stronger-for-longer USD and the possibility that EUR/USD will again move back towards the 1.03 area in the coming months.” ",fxstreet

Nevertheless, the pair maintains a large base, weekly MACD is close to confirming a cross into outright bullish territory and medium-term moving averages are now rising, therefore, our bias remains for an eventual closing break, with resistance then seen next at 0.8654/59 and beyond.” “First support is seen at 0.8434/26, then the 55-day average just below 0.8411/0.8393, with fresh buyers expected here if reached.” ",fxstreet

1,2022-05-25,"AUD/USD slides below mid-0.7000s, closer to weekly low ahead of US data/FOMC minutes","The AUD/USD pair witnessed an intraday turnaround from the 0.7120 region on Wednesday and continued losing ground through the mid-European session. The downward trajectory dragged spot prices back closer to the weekly low, below mid-0.7000s, and was sponsored by resurgent US dollar demand.In fact, the key USD Index staged a solid rebound from a nearly one-month low touched the previous day and was supported by growing concerns about softening global economic growth. The prospects for a more aggressive move by major central banks to constrain inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China have been fueling recession fears.The worries continued weighing on investors' sentiment, which was evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets. This, in turn, helped revive demand for the safe-haven greenback and drove flows away from the perceived riskier aussie. Apart from this, a strong intraday USD uptick could further be attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of the FOMC minutes.A 50 bps Fed rate hike move at the next two meetings is fully priced in and hence, market participants will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo rate hike in June.

1,2022-05-25,GBP/USD slides back below 1.2500 with Fed speak/minutes in focus,"GBP/USD is back to trading below the 1.2500 level on Wednesday after failing to sustain a rally into the upper 1.2500s earlier in the day as the US dollar saw some dip-buying demand ahead of more Fed speak/minutes and US Durable Goods Orders data. The pair was last trading in the 1.2490s, down about 0.3% on the day, with traders also likely enticed to sell the earlier rally into the upper 1.2500s in lieu of Tuesday’s downbeat UK PMI data which reignited fears about UK economic weakness and cast further doubt about how much more the BoE can afford to tighten monetary policy.BoE Chief Economist Huw did not react to the latest UK data in an interview published on Wednesday but did say that while he sees more tightening as needed, it won’t be necessary for the BoE to adopt a “super restrictive” policy stance. Pill highlighted the risks of overdoing tightening and worsening a recession versus the risks of not doing enough and allowing inflation to sustain momentum. By contrast, remarks from Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard at 1615GMT followed by the release of the minutes of the Fed’s latest meeting at 1800GMT are expected to outline the Fed’s much more hawkish stance that significant further monetary tightening, including the possibility of taking interest rates well into restrictive territory, is likely.That differential in central bank policy expectations may continue to block GBP/USD path high beyond the 1.2600 level. Indeed, the pair’s recent bullish trend looks at risk of breaking, which could open up the prospect of a dip back to its 21-Day Moving Average around 1.2425. A break below here would open the door to a move back to earlier monthly lows under 1.2200. Note that politics is also a potential headwind for sterling at the moment; UK PM Boris Johnson remains under pressure to step down with senior UK civil servant Sue Gray expected to publish a report on “partygate” later in the day. All the while, UK/EU tensions regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP) continue to bubble.  ",fxstreet
1,2022-05-25,When are the US durable goods orders and how could they affect EUR/USD?,"Wednesday's US economic docket highlights the release of Durable Goods Orders data for April. The US Census Bureau will publish the monthly report at 12:30 GMT and is expected to show that headline orders rose 0.6% during the reported month as compared to the 1.1% growth reported in March. Orders excluding transportation items, which tend to have a broader impact, are also anticipated to have increased by 0.6% in April, down from a 1.4% increase in the previous month.A surprisingly stronger than expected readings should allow the US dollar to build on its solid rebound from a nearly one-month low touched the previous day. Conversely, disappointing data will add to concerns about softening economic growth and force investors to scale back expectations for a more aggressive policy tightening by the Fed. That said, any immediate market reaction is more likely to be short-lived ahead of the FOMC monetary policy meeting minutes, scheduled for release later during the US session.Eren Sengezer, Editor at FXStreet, outlined important technical levels to trade the EUR/USD pair: “In case Tuesday's monthly high at 1.0750 is taken as the end-point of the uptrend that started on May 13, the Fibonacci 23.6% retracement at 1.0660 forms significant support. Right below that level, the 200-period SMA on the four-hour chart aligns as next support at 1.0640. With a four-hour close below the latter, EUR/USD could extend its slide toward 1.0600, where the ascending trend line meets the Fibonacci 38.2% retracement level.”“On the upside, 1.0700 (psychological level, static level) aligns as initial resistance ahead of 1.0750 (monthly high). The pair needs to reclaim 1.0700 and stabilize above that level for bulls to retain control of the pricing action,” Eren added further. •  EUR/USD Forecast: Bulls need to defend 1.0660 to keep sellers at bay •  EUR/USD: Rally unlikely to extend towards the 1.08-1.09 area – ING •  EUR/USD: Bears regain control and visit the sub-1.0700 areaThe Durable Goods Orders, released by the US Census Bureau, measures the cost of orders received by manufacturers for durable goods, which means goods planned to last for three years or more, such as motor vehicles and appliances.

In Japan, he continued, pent-up household demand has been limited and the recovery of aggregate demand has been slower than in Europe and the US. Meanwhile, wages in Japan have risen, but the rate of increase has remained moderate. The appropriate monetary policy response to inflation will differ between countries, he continued, though a common challenge for each country is to determine the magnitude and persistence of inflationary pressures. Uncertainties over geopolitical risks are extremely high, Kuroda noted, and could put downwards pressure on the global economy by shrinking trade and damaging confidence. ",fxstreet

1,2022-05-25,"NZD/USD Price Analysis: Surrenders RBNZ-inspired gains to multi-week high, near 38.2% Fibo.","The NZD/USD pair caught aggressive bids near the 0.6420-0.6415 region on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hinted at even higher rates going forward. Spot prices rallied around 100 pips from the daily low and shot to a nearly three-week high, though bulls struggled to capitalize on the move.The market sentiment remains fragile amid the worsening global economic outlook and recession fears. Apart from this, a solid US dollar rebound from the monthly low touched overnight kept a lid on any further gains for the risk-sensitive kiwi and attracted some selling near the 0.6515-0.6520 region.From a technical perspective, the post-RBNZ strong move up faltered just ahead of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the 0.7035-0.6217 downfall. This should now act as a key pivotal point, which if cleared will set the stage for an extension of a near two-week-old recovery move from the YTD low.Bulls might then aim back to reclaim the 0.6600 round-figure mark and lift the NZD/USD pair further towards the 50% Fibo. level, around the 0.6625 zone. The next relevant hurdle is pegged near the 0.6655 area (50-day SMA) ahead of the very important 200-day SMA, around the 0.6700 round-figure mark.On the flip side, the daily swing low, around the 0.6420-0.6415 region, coincides with 23.6% Fibo. level and should protect the immediate downside.

The broad rebound in the US dollar, despite a cautious market mood, is weighing negatively on the bright metal. Although the latest Fed commentary, which expressed concerns of soft-landing, undermines the US Treasury yields across the curve. This, in turn, helps XAUSUD to find a floor, for now.Also read: Gold Price Forecast: XAUUSD bulls await Fed minutes for the next upside legThe Technical Confluences Detector shows that the Gold Price is teasing the $1,855 support area, which is the convergence of the pivot point one-day S1 and the previous low four-hour.Failure to resist above the latter will trigger a fresh drop towards the $1,850 cap, where the previous day’s low and the previous week’s high coincide.Gold sellers will then look out for the $1,845 demand zone, which is the intersection of the SMA5 one-day and pivot point one-month S1.Further down, the SMA200 one-day at $1,839 will be put to test.On the upside, XAU bulls could face initial resistance at around $1,862 on buying resurgence. That level is the confluence of the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day and SMA10 four-hour.      The Fibonacci 23.6% one-day at $1,865 will then challenge the bearish commitments.The previous day’s high of $1,870 and the previous month’s low of $1,872 will be next on the buyers’ radars. The TCD (Technical Confluences Detector) is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc.  If you are a short-term trader, you will find entry points for counter-trend strategies and hunt a few points at a time.

The white metal has now eroded a major part of the overnight gains to over a two-week high and was last seen hovering near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the $23.24-$20.46 downfall.Looking at the broader picture, the XAG/USD, for the third straight day, failed near the 61.8% Fibo. level, around the $22.20 region. The said barrier should now act as a pivotal point, which if cleared decisively will be seen as a fresh trigger for bullish traders and set the stage for an extension of the recent recovery move from the YTD low.Meanwhile, oscillators on the daily chart remained in the bearish territory and have just started gaining negative traction on hourly charts. The technical set-up now seems to favour bearish traders, though it will be prudent to wait for sustained weakness below the 50% Fibo. level before positioning for any further depreciating move.The aforementioned support now coincides with the 100-hour SMA, below which the XAG/USD could fall to the $21.65 intermediate support before dropping to the 38.2% Fibo. level, around mid-$21.00s. Some follow-through selling below the $21.30-$21.25 region will reaffirm the negative bias and expose the 23.6% Fibo. level, around the $21.15 area.The next relevant support is pegged near the $21.00 round-figure mark, below which the XAG/USD could slide back to the YTD low, around the $20.45 region touched early. The downward trajectory could further get extended towards challenging the key $20.00 psychological mark.On the flip side, momentum back above the $22.00 mark might continue to confront stiff resistance near the $22.20 area (61.8% Fibo. level). Any subsequent move up is more likely to remain capped near the $21.35 region. A convincing breakthrough the said hurdle has the potential to lift spot prices towards the next relevant resistance near the $22.65 zone.  ",fxstreet

The pair was last seen trading just below mid-1.2800s, up nearly 0.20% for the day.The US dollar staged a solid recovery from a fresh monthly low touched the previous day, which, in turn, was seen as a key factor that pushed the USD/CAD pair higher for the second straight day. Despite signs of stability in the financial markets, the worsening global economic outlook extended some support to the safe-haven greenback.Apart from this, the strong intraday USD move up could further be attributed to some repositioning trade ahead of the FOMC meeting minutes, due for release later during the US session. Given that a 50 bps Fed rate hike at the next two meetings is fully priced in, investors will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo rate hike in June.Heading into the key event risk, the US Durable Goods Orders might provide some impetus during the early North American session. In the meantime, the underlying bullish sentiment surrounding crude oil prices could lend some support to the commodity-linked loonie and act as a headwind for the USD/CAD pair, warranting caution for aggressive bulls.Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying beyond the overnight swing high, around the 1.2870-1.2875 region, before confirming that the USD/CAD pair has bottomed out. The subsequent move up could push spot prices to the 1.2900 mark, which if cleared decisively would set the stage for a further near-term appreciating move.  ",fxstreet

In France, the Consumer Confidence came in short of expectations in May at 86 (from April’s 87).In the NA session, weekly Mortgage Applications are due seconded by Durable Goods Orders, while the release of the FOMC Minutes will close the daily calendar later in the day.The sharp rebound in EUR/USD surpassed the 1.0700 mark on the back by the strong resurgence of the risk-on mood.Despite the pair’s current upside impulse, the broader outlook for the single currency remains in the negative territory for the time being. As usual, price action in spot should reflect dollar dynamics, geopolitical concerns and the Fed-ECB divergence.Occasional pockets of strength in the single currency, however, should appear reinforced by speculation the ECB could raise rates at some point in the summer, while higher German yields, elevated inflation and a decent pace of the economic recovery in the region are also supportive of an improvement in the mood around the euro.Key events in the euro area this week: Germany Final Q1 GDP, GfK Consumer Confidence, ECB Lagarde (Wednesday).Eminent issues on the back boiler: Speculation of the start of the hiking cycle by the ECB as soon as this summer.

The pair held on to its modest intraday gains through the early European session and was last seen trading near the daily high, around mid-1.2500s.Some cross-driven strength stemming from a dramatic turnaround in the EUR/GBP cross turned out to be a key factor that extended some support to the GBP/USD pair. Apart from this, the uptick lacked any obvious fundamental catalyst and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly amid diminishing odds for any further interest rate hikes by the Bank of England.The flash UK PMIs released on Tuesday showed a sharp deceleration in growth during May and reinforced the BoE's gloomy outlook, warning that Britain is on course to enter a technical recession. This, in turn, suggested that the current rate hike cycle could be nearing a pause, which, along with the UK-EU impasse, should hold back the GBP bulls from placing aggressive bets.On the other hand, the US dollar made a solid comeback and reversed a major part of the overnight slide to a one-month low. This might further contribute to keeping a lid on any meaningful gains for the GBP/USD pair. The fundamental backdrop seems tilted firmly in favour of bearish traders and suggests that any subsequent move up might still be seen as a selling opportunity.There isn't any major market-moving data due for release from the UK, while the US economic docket features Durable Goods Orders. The focus, however, will remain glued to the FOMC monetary policy meeting minutes, due for release later during the US session.

Adding to this, a modest bounce in the global risk sentiment further benefitted the risk sensitive aussie, though the emergence of some US dollar buying capped gains ahead of the FOMC minutes.From a technical perspective, the recent strong recovery from the YTD low has been along an upward sloping channel, which points to a well-established short-term bullish trend. The lower boundary of the said trend channel coincides with the 100-hour SMA and should act as a pivotal point. This is closely followed by the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 0.6829-0.7128 rally.A convincing break below the latter will be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders and prompt aggressive technical selling.

2,2022-05-25,Gold Price Forecast: XAUUSD retreats from two-week high amid modest USD strength,"Gold witnessed some selling on Wednesday and snapped a five-day winning streak to over a two-week high, around the $1,870 area set the previous day. The XAUUSD extended its steady intraday descent through the early European session and touched a fresh daily low, near the $1,856 region in the last hour. The US dollar made a solid comeback and reversed a major part of the overnight losses to a one-month low. This, in turn, was seen as a key factor that undermined the dollar-denominated commodity. Apart from this, a goodish recovery in the US equity futures exerted additional downward pressure on the safe-haven precious metal.The downside, however, seems limited, at least for the time being, amid the worsening global economic outlook. Investors remain worried that a more aggressive move by major central banks to constrain inflation could pose challenges to global economic growth. Adding to this, the Russia-Ukraine war and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China have been fueling recession fears. This, along with the idea that the Fed could pause the rate hike cycle later this year and a softer tone surrounding the US Treasury bond yields, could act as a tailwind for the non-yielding gold. Hence, the focus remains on the FOMC meeting minutes.Given that a 50 bps Fed rate hike move at the next two meetings is fully priced in, market participants will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo hike in June. This will play a key role in influencing the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a fresh directional impetus to gold. Heading into the key event risk, the US Durable Goods Orders data could drive the greenback later during the early North American session. Apart from this, the US bond yields and the broader risk sentiment could produce short-term trading opportunities.  ",fxstreet

However, with key moving averages still rising, we expect support at 6.5791/5440 to hold to keep the risks higher in the medium term and still anticipate a move to 6.8475 in due course.”“A fall below the 50% retracement of the March/May surge at 6.5794/6.5440 would seriously question our medium-term bullish outlook and open the door to the late April low and the 61.8% retracement at 6.5117/6.4967.” ",fxstreet

The rapid drop appears to be overdone and USD is unlikely to weaken further. For today, we expect USD to consolidate and trade between 126.40 and 127.40.”Next 1-3 weeks: “Our latest narrative was from Monday (23 May, spot at 127.90) where there is room for USD to retest the 127.00 level. We added, ‘a breach of this level is not ruled out but at this stage but any further decline is expected to face solid support at 126.50’. USD cracked 127.00 yesterday and plummeted to 126.35 before rebounding. While oversold, the decline has room to extend to 126.00, possibly 125.60. Overall, only a break of 127.90 (‘strong resistance’ level was at 128.55 yesterday) would indicate that weakness in USD that started about two weeks ago has run its course.”",fxstreet
2,2022-05-25,EUR/CHF to trade close to the 1.02/1.03 area in the months ahead – Rabobank,"The better tone in the euro has allowed EUR/CHF to move higher in recent sessions. Economists at Rabobank expect the pair to hover around the 1.02/03 region as the European Central Bank (ECB) will be unable to hike rates amid a European oil embargo on Russia.“Under the cover of ECB rate hikes, the SNB may be able to execute a little bout of policy tightening of its own to pull its key rate back towards zero without creating too many waves for the EUR/CHF exchange rate. That said, while currency strength was a problem for the SNB when inflationary pressure was low, it is unlikely to be viewed in the same way in the current environment.” “We think that there will be an EU oil embargo on Russia. This could make a recession unavoidable for the eurozone and make the window of opportunity for ECB rate hikes very limited. In this scenario, safe-haven demand would likely keep EUR/CHF close to the 1.02/1.03 area in the months ahead.”  ",fxstreet

The positive economic effect of the corona restrictions coming to an end seems to be easing. Instead, the high cost of living is leading to cautious consumer spending.”“In view of yesterday’s data, it can be assumed that the BoE will continue to sound cautious, which is likely to put pressure on sterling.”If the economy continues to provide negative surprises over the coming months the market might further correct its rate expectations to the downside, putting pressure on sterling.”  ",fxstreet
3,2022-05-25,AUD/USD: A sustained advance is expected above 0.7135 – UOB,"In the opinion of FX Strategists at UOB Group Lee Sue Ann and Quek Ser Leang, extra gains in AUD/USD area likely on a breakout of the 0.7135 level in the near term.24-hour view: “We highlighted yesterday that ‘slowing upward momentum coupled with overbought conditions suggest that AUD is unlikely to advance further’ and we expected AUD to ‘trade between 0.7040 and 0.7115’. AUD subsequently traded sideways but within a narrower range than expected (0.7057/0.7115). The underlying tone has improved slightly and we see chance for AUD to test the major resistance at 0.7135 before the risk of a pullback would increase. The next resistance at 0.7165 is not expected to come into the picture. Support is at 0.7075 followed by 0.7050.”Next 1-3 weeks: “Two days ago (23 May, spot at 0.7070), we highlighted that upward momentum is beginning to build and the risk is tilted to the upside towards 0.7135. We indicated that AUD has to close above 0.7135 before a sustained advance is likely. Since then, AUD has not been able to make much headway on the upside. However, there is no change in our view for now and only a breach of 0.7025 ( ‘strong support’ level was at 0.7000 yesterday) would indicate that the build-up upward pressure has eased.”",fxstreet

Further, prices of benchmark three-month contract of copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) also dropped below $9,500 by nearly 1.0% at the latest. In doing so, the red metal takes clues from firmer USD and fears of global growth, as well as chatters surrounding more production, heading into Wednesday’s European session.Covid-led lockdowns in the world’s biggest copper consumer China join fears of economic hardships due to the skyrocketing inflation and the Russia-Ukraine offers a first-hand attack on the commodity prices.Adding to the price-negative catalysts were the latest headlines suggesting a solution to protests at Peru’s Las Bambas copper mine. “The leader of a Peruvian indigenous community, whose protest led MMG's Las Bambas copper mine to suspend operations over a month ago, said on Tuesday that ""progress"" has been made toward a solution to the crisis,” said Reuters.Elsewhere, the US Dollar Index (DXY) rises 0.27% intraday while bouncing off a four-week low to regain the 102.00 threshold. The DXY rebound tracks the US 10-year Treasury yields, bouncing off the monthly low while rising 0.8 basis points (bps) to 2.767%. Underlying the rebound in the yields could be the risk-negative headlines from China and North Korea, as well as the market’s preparations for the US Durable Goods Orders for April, expected 0.6% versus 1.1% prior, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes.Alternatively, geopolitical fears concerning North Korea and Taiwan seem to defend the buyers but have failed so far.Analysts at Citibank sound too bearish on copper as they said, ""Recent consumption run rates imply copper and aluminum shifted into surplus globally in April.""

There are economic uncertainties and risks in the eurozone too which could cause the ECB to act more cautiously, in particular in case we might see an energy crisis. That is why I think that the euro might be unable to rise much further after the market has already adjusted its rate expectations considerably.“In view of the fact that the ECB now wants to act more decisively against price risks, there is a lot to suggest that the euro might have bottomed at 1.04 in EUR/USD.” ",fxstreet

A bullish open drive session has been shown by the asset and is now preparing for an initiative buying action. The pair has rebounded after hitting a low of 0.9587 amid exhaustion in the downtrend.Earlier, the pair remained in a negative trajectory as the US dollar index (DXY) witnessed a steep fall after an improvement in the risk appetite of the market participants. In today’s session, a minor rebound in the DXY has supported the greenback-dominated currencies. The DXY has attracted bets amid uncertainty over the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which will release in the New York session. Apart from that, the US Durable Goods Orders are on the investor’s radar.  The US Census Bureau is expected to report the monthly Durable Goods Orders at 0.6% against the prior print of 1.1%.

In doing so, the black gold justifies a pullback in the RSI line.However, the 100-HMA and 200-HMA confluence of around $109.00 appears a tough nut to crack for the oil sellers. Also challenging the WTI bears is the immediate ascending trend line on RSI (14), suggesting gradually firming bullish momentum.Also acting as the key downside support is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of May 10-17 upside, near $103.30, as well as the $100.00 psychological magnet.Meanwhile, a clear upside break of the weekly resistance line, at $110.50 by the press time, needs validation from $111.30 to challenge the monthly high surrounding $115.50.It’s worth noting that late March’s peak near $116.60 acts as an additional upside filter before directing the WTI crude oil prices towards the yearly high of $129.42.Trend: Further upside expected  ",fxstreet

We added, ‘the major resistance at 1.0750 is unlikely to come under threat for now’. Our view was not wrong as EUR rose to a high of 1.0748.

We indicated that the next resistance level of note is at 1.0750. Our view was not wrong as EUR rose to within a couple of pips of 1.0750 (high has been 1.0748). From here, a break of 1.0750 would not be surprising and would shift the focus to 1.0800. That said, overbought shorter-term conditions could lead to a couple of days of consolidation first.

Even so, the Loonie pair remains mostly sidelined while rising to 1.2830 by the press time.The mixed play of the firmer US dollar and upbeat price of Canada’s key export WTI crude oil seems to challenge the USD/CAD traders of late.Talking about the greenback, the US Dollar Index (DXY) rises 0.21% intraday while bouncing off a four-week low to regain the 102.00 threshold. The DXY rebound tracks the US 10-year Treasury yields, bouncing off the monthly low while rising 0.8 basis points (bps) to 2.767%. Underlying the rebound in the yields could be the risk-negative headlines from China and North Korea, as well as the market’s preparations for the US Durable Goods Orders for April, expected 0.6% versus 1.1% prior, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes.Read: FOMC May Minutes Preview: Will the Fed have to sell MBS?On the other hand, geopolitical fears from North Korea’s missile launches and China’s readiness for a military drill near the border of Taiwan, contradicting the US wish to defend Taipei, seem to help the crude oil prices amid fears of a supply crunch. It should be noted that the previously dominant supply crunch catalysts like the Russia-Ukraine war and China’s covid-led lockdown also help the black gold prices.

The pair has comfortably shifted into the bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which indicates more upside ahead.The asset is facing barricades at the 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is trading at 1.2600. While an establishment above 50-EMA, which is hovering around 1.2465 confirms short-term bullish momentum.Should the asset displays a pullback move to near 50-EMA at 1.2465, a responsive buying action will drive the asset towards Monday’s high at 1.2601. An occurrence of the same will further push the asset towards April 25 low at 1.2698.Alternatively, a slippage below May 19 low at 1.2330 will drag the asset to near March 6 low at 1.2261, followed by March 13 low at 1.2155.  ",fxstreet

The DXY rebound tracks the US 10-year Treasury yields, bouncing off the monthly low while rising 0.8 basis points (bps) to 2.767%. Underlying the rebound in the yields could be the risk-negative headlines from China and South Korea, as well as the market’s preparations for the US Durable Goods Orders for April, expected 0.6% versus 1.1% prior, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes.Previously, the biggest monthly fall in the US New Home Sales in nine years joined downbeat preliminary activity data to portray grim concerns for the world’s largest economy, which in turn drowned the US dollar.Also, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde and Vice President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis portrayed the bloc’s economic resilience and propelled the Euro versus the greenback. Further, German PMI was firmer for May while the Eurozone numbers were softer-than-expected but couldn’t detail the EUR advances. It should be noted that some of the ECB policymakers have uttered the 50 bps rate hike calls for July and offered notable strength to the Euro.That said, the EUR/USD pair’s short-term moves rely on the ECB versus Fed divergence, which in turn highlights today’s FOMC Minutes and US Durable Goods Orders, not to forget German GfK sentiment figures, GDP data and a speech from ECB President Lagarde.Also read: Read: FOMC May Minutes Preview: Will the Fed have to sell MBS?EUR/USD seesaws around the 11-week-old resistance-turned-support line, near 1.0710 by the press time, amid firmer RSI (14).

The DXY rebound could be linked to the risk-negative headlines from China and South Korea, as well as the market’s preparations for the US Durable Goods Orders for April, expected 0.6% versus 1.1% prior, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes.On the other hand, a Reuters poll mentioned that India's equity markets will mark their first annual decline in seven years in 2022 as higher interest rates and weakening growth prospects reduce the chances of a quick rebound from this year's already sharp drop. The justification for the same said, “Soaring inflation in India and around the world, with frayed supply chains made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has pushed most central banks to begin raising interest rates, triggering hefty outflows from risky assets.” It should be observed that India’s benchmark equity index BSE Sensex drops 7.0% during 2022.That said, mixed sentiment and USD recovery could keep the USD/INR prices firmer ahead of key US data and Fed Minutes. The upside, however, needs to be backed by firmer US data and the FOMC member’s growing concerns over inflation, which in turn pushes them towards a more than 50 bps rate hike.Unless breaking a 50-pip trading range between 77.35 and 77.85, USD/INR remains less interesting. However, the recent bearish RSI divergence hints that the pair buyers are running out of steam and hence any clear downside break of the 77.35 will be welcomed with zeal.  ",fxstreet

To safeguard the kiwi economy from the adverse impact of galloping inflation, the central bank is welcoming the certainty of recession.In its monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, RBNZ Governor announced a rate hike by 50 basis points (bps). It is worth noting that the RBNZ has elevated its Official Cash Rate (OCR) by half a percent consecutively. Officially, the RBNZ’s OCR has been increased to 2%.Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) has recovered the majority of its losses recorded on Tuesday. The DXY is attempting to overstep the round-level resistance of 102.00.

However, any more bearish signals from the FOMC Minutes and/or downbeat US data will allow the precious metal to pare recent losses.Gold Price stays pressured inside a weekly bullish channel, recently tracking RSI (14) as it retreats.Given the RSI pullback from the overbought territory, coupled with the failure to cross the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement (Fibo.) of the April 18 to May 16 downturn, XAU/USD is likely to decline further.However, a convergence of the aforementioned channel’s support and the 100-SMA, around $1,848, appears a tough nut to crack for the gold sellers.In a case where gold drops below $1,848, a south-run towards the $1,800 threshold will precede the bear’s intention to refresh the monthly low, around $1,787 by the press time, which can’t be ruled out.On the contrary, the resistance line of the stated channel, at $1,878 by the press time, will test the XAU/USD bulls should they cross the 38.2% Fibo. near $1,867.Even so, a confluence of the 200-SMA and 50% Fibonacci retracement level, close to $1,892, will challenge the metal’s further upside.Trend: Further weakness expected  ",fxstreet

Considering the positive market mood and DXY’s price action, further weakness in the asset cannot be ruled out. In spite of that, investors' focus will remain on the release of the FOMC minutes.Facts that hold significant importance in the FOMC minutes are the number of voters behind the advocacy of the 50 basis points (bps) interest rate hike and economic indicators that may describe the US economic condition in a much more explanatory manner. Apart from the FOMC minutes, the US Durable Goods data hold significant importance. The US Census Bureau is expected to report the monthly Durable Goods Orders at 0.6% against the prior print of 1.1%.On an hourly scale, XAU/USD is auctioning in a Rising Channel that advocates gold bulls. The upper boundary of the Rising Channel is placed from May 17 high at $1,835.97 while the lower boundary is plotted from May 16 low at $1,786.78. A golden cross, represented by the 50- and 200-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) has set a bullish bias for the gold prices. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) has shifted into a bullish range of 60.00-80.00, which adds to the upside filters.    ",fxstreet
5,2022-05-25,When is the RBNZ and how it could affect NZD/USD?,"Early Wednesday at 01:00 GMT market sees the key monetary policy decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) amid hopes of another hawkish play by the New Zealand central bank.Despite the recently mixed data at home, not to forget China’s growth concerns, the RBNZ policymakers are likely bracing for a fourth rate hike, worth 50 basis points (bps) to 2.0%.Although such a rate-hike is already priced-in, recent geopolitical tensions surrounding North Korea and Russia join some optimists calling for consecutive 50 basis points (bps) of a rate-lifts in the future to make today’s RBNZ Interest Rate Decision interesting for the NZD/USD traders.Also in the publishing line are the economic projections and Governor Adrian Orr’s speech to watch.Ahead of the event, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said,A 50bp hike to 2% is widely expected, as the RBNZ seeks to get the OCR back to a more neutral level as soon as they can (their estimate at the February MPS was that neutral is around about 2%). Interest rate decisions will likely become more difficult over the second half of the year, especially as evidence of cooling demand starts to mount. As such, we anticipate they will return to more normal 25bp hikes as they assess how previous interest rate hikes are transmitting through the economy.On the same line, analysts at Westpac said,Westpac expects the RBNZ to hike the Official Cash Rate by another 50 basis points to 2.0% with a clear signal of further tightening to come. Its OCR forecast will be of particular interest.Considering the market consensus, FXStreet’s Dhwani Mehta said,The currency pair could witness a ‘sell the fact’ trading on an expected 50 bps hike with dovish forward guidance, as the RBNZ could be worried about hard-landing risks. In such a case, an extended correction towards May 20 lows of 0.6363 could be in the offing.The market’s perception at the time of the policy announcement and the US dollar price action ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC Minutes could also affect NZD/USD’s reaction. NZD/USD snaps a four-day uptrend by dropping back to mid-0.6400s ahead of the RBNZ. The Kiwi pair’s latest weakness could be linked to the US dollar’s rebound from the monthly low, as well as to the second-tier threats to the risk appetite.That said, the RBNZ rate hike worth 50 bps is already priced-in as the NZD/USD prices keep the previous week’s recovery from a two-year low. Hence, an increase in the benchmark rate worth the estimations won’t make any major difference to the Kiwi pair trader until the accompanying economic forecasts portray a rosy picture of the Pacific economy, which is less anticipated due to the recently mixed statistics.Hence, NZD/USD prices may provide a knee-jerk reaction to the RBNZ’s 50 bps rate hike but any disappointment, either via softer rate action or from the Rate Statement, will have larger repercussions.Technically, NZD/USD justifies Tuesday’s pin bar with the recent losses, suggesting further pullback towards the 21-DMA support of 0.6394. However, any further downside will make the Kiwi pair vulnerable to testing the 0.6300 threshold. Meanwhile, the monthly high surrounding 0.6570 stays on the bull’s radar ahead of the RBNZ announcements.NZD/USD Price Analysis: Bulls seeking a higher correction on weekly chartNew Zealand 10-year Treasury yields renew five-week low under 3.45% ahead of RBNZ NZD/USD can't catch a break ahead of the RBNZReserve Bank of New Zealand Preview: Will they step up their tightening game?The RBNZ interest rate decision is announced by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

5,2022-05-25,EUR/USD Price Analysis: Pullback from monthly top remains elusive above 1.0710,"EUR/USD refreshes intraday low around 1.0720, consolidating weekly gains near the monthly peak. In doing so, the major currency pair prints weakness below the 50-DMA hurdle, as well as suggests further downside towards the 11-week-old resistance-turned-support line.It’s worth noting, however, that a firmer RSI (14) and a clear upside break of the previous resistance line, around 1.0710, keep the pair buyers hopeful.Even if the quote drops below 1.0710, the early month’s peak of 1.0641 and an upward sloping support line from May 13, close to 1.0570, will precede the 21-DMA level of 1.0547 to challenge the EUR/USD bears.Alternatively, the 50-DMA level of 1.0765 challenges the short-term upside of the EUR/USD pair ahead of a downward sloping trend line from February, near 1.0840.Should the quote rise past 1.0840, the late April swing high of 1.0936 and the 1.1000 psychological magnet will lure the EUR/USD bulls.Trend: Bullish  ",fxstreet
5,2022-05-25,RBA Ellis rehashes the board minutes and says there will be more rate rises from here,"RBA assistant governor for economics Luci Ellis on Wednesday has addressed the Urban Development Institute of Australia 2022 national conference in Sydney on ""Housing in the Endemic Phase"".The comments have been listed by central bank observers for any clues to the likely speed of interest rate hikes in coming months. Besides insights to the housing sector, on monetary policy, Ellis argued that there will be more rate rises from here but cannot say where the peak will be from here. Despite the prospects of further rate increases, the Aussie has remained in the early Asians session sell-off as the US dollar picks up a bid, retracing back to test the vicinity of the early New York session highs as per the DXY index. Meanwhile, the RBA raised the cash rate to 0.35 per cent from a record low 0.1 per cent this month, the first increase in over a decade, in the face of a spike in inflation to 5.1 per cent.The comments today from Ellis are a rehash of the minutes of that board meeting that agreed that further increases in interest rates would likely be required to ensure inflation returns to the two to three per cent target over time.At this stage, the market has priced in a further interest rate rise of between 25 basis points and 50 basis points at its June 7 board meeting, and a rate of over 1.5 per cent by early next year. ",fxstreet

In doing so, the Aussie pair also takes clues from the recent geopolitical tensions surrounding North Korea and the US, as well as the cautious mood ahead of the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes.RBA Assistant Governor (Economic) Luci Ellis said, ""There will be more rate rises from here."" The policymaker also mentioned that the housing industry is at capacity as supply lines snarl, per Reuters. The policymaker also said, “Australia's housing industry has a strong pipeline of new work but faces global supply disruptions and rising material costs which are delaying completions and squeezing margins”. Elsewhere, North Korea’s firing of three missiles and Japan’s dislike for the same join the market’s anxiety ahead of the today’s Fed Minutes seem to also weigh on the market’s optimism and probe the AUD/USD pair.It’s worth noting that a pause in the US Treasury yields’ fall around the monthly low near 2.70% also seems to probe the AUD/USD buyers.On Tuesday, downbeat prints of the US housing data and repeated Fedspeak, in contrast to the hawkish comments from the ECB, exerted downside pressure on the US Dollar. However, the Australian Dollar also couldn’t cheer the greenback’s weakness as May’s PMIs from the Pacific major also came in downbeat.Amid these plays, the S&P 500 Futures rise half a percent after mixed closing on the Wall Street whereas the US 10-year Treasury yields dropped the most in a week to refresh a one-month low of around 2.717%.Moving, Australia’s Q1 2022 Construction Work Done, expected 1.0% versus the prior 0.4%, may entertain AUD/USD traders but major attention will be given to the US Durable Goods Orders for April and FOMC minutes.Read: FOMC May Minutes Preview: Will the Fed have to sell MBS?Unless staying beyond the 0.7035-40 support confluence, including the 21-DMA and previous resistance line from April 05, AUD/USD prices remain directed towards the monthly high of 0.7267.  ",fxstreet

The DXY is scaling sharply lower from the past eight trading sessions after failing to hold the 19-year high at 105.00. The weakness in the DXY is backed by the expectations of recession in the US amid an aggressive rate hike cycle.The market participants are expecting that the Federal Reserve (Fed) has pulled the trigger of recession in the US while containing the inflation mess. The program of liquidity absorption from the market may force the corporate to stick to ultra-filtered investment avenues as the unavailability of dirt-cheap money will result in a restricted investment portfolio.FOMC MinutesThe show-stopper event on Wednesday will be the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes.

That said, the bright metal rises to $22.15 at the latest.Not only a break of the short-term key moving average but bullish MACD signals also underpin the upside bias for the commodity prices.That said, a descending trend line from April 29, around $22.40, appears immediate key resistance for the quote to cross.Following that, a run-up towards the $23.00 threshold and late April swing high close to $23.60 can’t be ruled out.However, an area comprising the 50-DMA and the 100-DMA around $23.70-80, appears a tough nut to crack for the XAG/USD bulls afterward.On the contrary, pullback moves may have to defy the DMA breakout, around $22.00 by the press time, to direct silver prices towards a two-week-long horizontal rea near $21.20-10.In a case where the metal remains weak past $21.10, also conquers the $21.00 threshold, it can plummet to the $20.00 psychological magnet.Trend: Further upside expected  ",fxstreet

The pair witnessed a steep fall on Tuesday after slipping below a two-day low of 127.09. An imbalance move from the previous auction area of 127.09-128.32 has dampened the demand for the greenback.A breakdown of the Head and Shoulder chart pattern on an hourly scale is underpinning the Japanese yen against the greenback. The breakdown of an H&S pattern denotes a prolonged inventory distribution from institutional investors to retain participants. A decisive slippage below the round level support of 127.00 has marked the trigger of the H&S breakdown.The death cross, represented by the 50- and 200-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) at 130.00 is signaling a confirmed bearish bias in the counter.Meanwhile, a range shift has been displayed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (14) from 40.00-60.00 to the bearish range of 20.00-40.00 which advocates more downside.Investors should attempt shorts after a pullback towards the 50-EMA at 127.38 for a downside move to Tuesday’s Low at 126.48, followed by the round-level support at 125.00.Alternatively, the greenback bulls could regain strength if the asset oversteps Thursday’s high at 128.95, which will drive the asset towards May 17 high at 129.78.

It’s worth noting that the confluence of Bollinger’s band lower band with the previously-mentioned moving average is a zone that could find some buyers stepping in as the greenback remains in an uptrend. Nevertheless, the two-week pullback weighed on the USD/CHF, which has fallen almost 500 pips from the YTD high at the parity; however, the RSI, albeit in bearish territory, begins to aim higher, meaning the major might consolidate before resuming upwards/downwards.Upwards, the USD/CHF first resistance would be the 0.9700 mark. If USD/CHF bulls reclaim the aforementioned, a re-test of the 20-DMA at 0.9823 is on the cards, but firstly, a break above the 0.9800 mark is needed before extending the pair’s rally.On the flip side, the USD/CHF first support would be 0.9600. Break below would expose the confluence of the 50-DMA and Bollinger’s band lower band around 0.9558. Once cleared, the next demand zone would be March 16, 0.9533 daily high.  ",fxstreet

It’s worth noting that the risk-aversion couldn’t lift the US dollar on downbeat Treasury yields ahead of today’s Minutes of the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).US New Home Sales for April marked the biggest monthly fall in nine years with 16.6% MoM figures and sparked concerns over the growth of the world’s largest economy, especially at the time when inflation fears are mounting. The same weighed down the US Treasury yields and the US Dollar Index (DXY) as Fed policymakers keep repeating the 50 bps rate hike concerns. It’s worth noting that the US preliminary activity numbers for May also came in softer and exerted additional downside pressure on the greenback.That said, the US 10-year Treasury yields dropped the most in a week to refresh a one-month low around 2.717% while the DXY extended the week-start fall towards late April bottom near 101.70. Elsewhere, the Wall Street benchmarks closed mixed, after an initially downbeat performance.Not only the USD weakness but the economic optimism among the European policymakers and upbeat data from Germany also weighed on the EUR/USD prices. On Tuesday, the European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde joined Vice President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis to portray the economic resilience of the bloc. Further, German PMI was firmer for May while the Eurozone numbers were softer-than-expected. It should be noted that some of the ECB policymakers have recently spread direct comments on the 50 bps rate hike in July and offered notable strength to the Euro.That said, the EUR/USD traders may pay attention to the qualitative catalysts ahead of the European morning and hence a risk-off mood may consolidate some of the pair’s latest gains. However, German GfK sentiment figures, GDP data and a speech from ECB President Lagarde will be crucial to watch afterward.

Despite the long-term daily moving averages (DMAs) residing below the exchange rate, price action in the 1-hour chart depicts a successive series of lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL). Hence, a downward move towards the previously tested 157.99 weekly low is on the cards.That said, the GBP/JPY first support would be May 19 swing low at 158.75. Break below would expose the May 24 daily low at 157.99, followed by the May 16 swing low at 157.42.  ",fxstreet
6,2022-05-24,"Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD bulls stay on top, but bears lurking at daily resistance","The gold price has been moving higher on Tuesday as the US dollar gave way to the bears yet again, sliding to a one-month low following hawkish rhetoric from the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. The governor said the eurozone interest rates will likely be in positive territory by the end of the third quarter. Consequently, the markets moved out of the greenback and spread the demand across its rivals.Against a basket of other major currencies (DXY), the dollar was down 0.362% at 101.646, its lowest since April 25. The greenback also weakened further after data showed US business activity slowed moderately in May. S&P Global said its flash US Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, showed the pace of growth was the slowest in four months. US New-Home Sales also slowed to a 591,000 annual rate in April from a downwardly revised 709,000 rate in March, below the 749,000-rate expected.Additionally, negativity returned to risk markets and major equity market indexes ended mixed Tuesday as Snap (SNAP) said it expects second-quarter revenue to miss its own guidance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to end 0.2% higher at 31,928.62. The S&P 500 declined 0.8% to 3,941.48 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell by 2.4% to 11,264.45. Investors moved into bonds instead and this sent the US 10-year yield lower by 10.1 basis points to 2.76% after reaching its lowest intraday level since mid-April earlier in the session.''Gold traders are increasingly questioning the Fed's willingness to hike into a recession, as growing economic concern is breathing life into the gold market. Upside flow from CTAs along with renewed growth in ETFs have supported the recovery,'' analysts at TD Securities argued.''In turn, the improving momentum has seen the nearest trigger within trend-following models flip toward further upside should prices break north of $1900/oz, rather than a whipsaw lower. Nonetheless, the recovery in the yellow metal is still on shaky ground as Fed Chair Powell signalled a willingness to sacrifice some economic growth in an effort to tame inflation, suggesting the Fed is comfortable with more pain before taking the foot off the break, which should ultimately still weigh on precious metals.''Gold is trapped between daily support and resistance still but is making headway.  However, the W-formation is a reversion pattern that could leave the price trapped in the sideways channel for the days ahead. If, however, there is a break one way or the other, of the current support and resistance, then the price imbalances to $1,883 on the upside and $1,780 to the downside could be mitigated. ",fxstreet

The weekly oil stockpiles rose to 0.567 million barrels against the previous figure of -2.445 million barrels.A general underperformance reported in the global Purchase Managers Index (PMI) economic data by various nations has raised concerns over the demand of oil on a broad basis. The US Manufacturing PMI remained similar to consensus at 57.5 but lower than the previous release. Europe’s Manufacturing PMI landed lower at 54.4 than estimates and prior print. Also, the UK’s Manufacturing PMI remained lower at 54.6 than forecasts and former figures. Therefore, a general underperformance in the economic activities by developed nations has showcased a plunge in the aggregate demand and henceforth the demand for fossil fuels.Going forward, oil bulls may get a sigh of relief as Shanghai is reopening after two-month severe lockdown restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19. It is worth noting that China is the leading importer of oil and the reopening of Shanghai may spurt the oil demand going forward. Apart from that, the upcoming US summer season is expected to increase the demand of fossil fuels.Meanwhile, Europe has not reached any meaningful decision regarding the embargo on Russian oil imports as Hungary is continuously opposing the sudden Russian oil ban to safeguard itself against the prompt supply shock.  ",fxstreet

Against a basket of other major currencies (DXY), the dollar was down to 101.646, its lowest level since April 25.Reuters reports that the greenback weakened further after data showed US business activity slowed in May as higher prices cooled demand for services while renewed supply constraints because of COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine hampered production at factories.''S&P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, showed the pace of growth was the slowest in four months.''   ",fxstreet
6,2022-05-24,EUR/JPY Price Analysis: A rising wedge in the daily chart looms and targets 132.00,"The EUR/JPY edges lower after reaching fresh weekly highs at around 136.79 and daily lows just below the 50-DMA at 135.64, blamed on a dampened market sentiment that increased appetite for safe-haven peers. At the time of writing, the EUR/JPY cross-currency pair is trading at 136.16.Risk aversion continued for the second consecutive day in the week. Global equities are trading lower on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will not achieve a soft landing as it tightens monetary conditions, aiming to tackle high inflation around quadruple its target. Furthermore, China’s coronavirus crisis, which spurred factory halts in April, particularly in Shanghai, clouds the economic outlook.Elsewhere, the EUR/JPY pair opened near the daily high and tumbled as sentiment turned sour, aiming towards the 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) at 135.95, breaking on its way south, support levels like the daily pivot point at 136.05. However, the cross-currency is back above the central daily pivot point, though down in the day by some 0.37%.The EUR/JPY daily chart depicts the pair as upward biased. However, the cross advances steadily and will face a solid supply area around the 137.00 mark, which EUR/JPY bulls have been unable to conquer.It’s worth noting that a rising wedge is forming, which, once broken, might open the door for further losses. That said, the EUR/JPY’s first support would be the 50-day moving average (DMA) at 135.64. A breach of the latter would open the door for a re-test of the rising wedge bottom trendline, around 134.80-135.10. Once cleared, the following demand zone would be the rising wedge target at 132.00, followed by the 200-DMA at 131.24.  ",fxstreet

Most European manufacturing and services indexes came in below the market’s expectation, except for the German ones, which were slightly better than April ones. The EU services PMI came down to 56.3 from 57.7 in the previous month, while the manufacturing index printed at 54.4, below the 54.9 expected.  UK figures were also disappointing, as business activity slowed down to its weakest since early 2021, according to the official report. Finally, the company reported that the US manufacturing index slid to 57.5 as expected, while the services index contracted to 53.5 in the same period.Meanwhile, inflation did not recede while the coronavirus-related lockdown in China exacerbated supply chain issues. In fact, JP Morgan downgraded China’s growth forecast to 3.7% from 4.3% in 2022, while other research institutes followed suit. The AUD/USD pair trades just below the 0.7100 level, while USD/CAD holds above 1.2800.

""Thus, real GDP growth will likely slow from 8.1% in 2021 to 4.3% in 2022."" ""New geopolitical, financial, or supply-side shocks could tip the world economy into recession.""Additionally, the price of oil is lower over the worries of not only a possible global recession but also China's COVID-19 curbs that have balanced tight global supply and US summer driving season demand. US crude prices have eased to $108.63 a barrel. Subsequently, the Canadian dollar has edged lower against its US counterpart on Tuesday.As for data, Canadian factory sales rose 1.6% in April from March, largely driven by higher sales of petroleum and coal products, Statistics Canada said in a flash estimate. A separate flash estimate for the same month showed that wholesale trade rose 0.2%.Overall, CAD could be in a better position compared to other growth currencies such as the antipodeans due to solid growth, commodity exposure, and domestic monetary tightening. However, ''markets are shifting into data-watching mode, and how this evolves will be relevant for broad USD dynamics over the tactical horizon, analysts at TD Securities argued and said that ''this is not a great setup for the CAD.''  ",fxstreet
6,2022-05-24,Silver Price Forecast: XAG/USD climbs steadily and tests the $22.00 mark,"Silver (XAG/USD) registers gains but appears to be glued to the $22.00 mark, as XAG/USD bulls failed to record a daily close above the $22.00 area for four consecutive days, albeit a dampened market mood. At the time of writing, the XAG/USD is trading at $22.05.US equities keep illustrating a dampened market mood in tone with the Asian and European sessions. S&P Global PMIs revealed that Europe and the US presented mixed results, increasing investors’ concerns that Europe and the US might suffer a  possible economic slowdown. The supply chain issues continue, and higher costs from raw materials would keep inflationary pressures elevated.Given the backdrop that the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary conditions in the US and is about to hike 50-bps in the June and July meetings, concerns about the US central bank achieving a soft or “softish landing,” as Fed Chair Powell said, look far to be done. That’s why market players keep the US stock market downward pressured and the US dollar softer.The US Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s value against a basket of its rivals, slides 0.24% and is down at 101.850. Failure to reclaim the 102.000 mark would open the door for a retest of April 21 swing low at 99.818. On the same note, the 10-year US Treasury yield grinds lower and loses almost ten basis points (bps), sitting at 2.761%, a tailwind for Silver prices.Elsewhere, Atlanta’s Fed President Raphael Bostic crossed the wires, though he sounded less “hawkish” than usually. Bostic said that rate hikes won’t cause a recession and that the central bank can hike rates to deal with overly high inflation without sending the US economy into recession. He stated that the US central bank could pause rate increases in September to review how the economy performs.Macroeconomic-wise, the US docket featured the US S&P Global PMIs for May, which illustrated mixed results, with the Services and Composite Indexes missing expectations while the Manufacturing PMI was unchanged. Furthermore, Richmond’s Fed Manufacturing Index plunged to -14 vs. 15 foreseen, adding to the Fed regional manufacturing reports showing deceleration or contraction.XAG/USD is still downward biased, despite recording gains for the third day out of the last four. However, it’s important that XAG/USD traders, need to be aware that Silver has struggled at the $22.00 mark. Failure at the previously mentioned would resume the downtrend and open the door for further losses.If that scenario plays out, the XAG/USD’s first support would be the May 19 pivot low at $21.28. Break below would expose the May 16 daily low at $20.84, followed by the YTD low at $20.45. However, if XAG/USD’s bulls accomplish a daily close above the $22.00 mark, that could allow further gains. The XAG/USD first resistance would be the psychological $23.00 mark. Once cleared, the next supply zones would be the May 5 swing high at $23.28, followed by a test of the 200-DMA at $23.57.  ",fxstreet
6,2022-05-24,EUR/USD Price Analysis: Bulls charge towards a critical weekly 50% mean reversion mile-stone,"As per the start of the week's analysis, EUR/USD Price Analysis: Bulls are taking over through key daily resistance, the price has continued higher as the bulls hunt down key weekly resistance structure. Breaking daily resistance in the opening sessions on Monday, EUR/USD breached the 38.2% Fibonacci of the weekly bearish impulse on Monday and has subsequently moved higher into the 1.07 areas with eyes on mid-late April daily swing lows near 1.0770. The following illustrates the bullish bias over a series of time frames. It was stated that ''the bulls are already penetrating the 38.2% Fibonacci and on the way to 1.07 the figure. A move towards the 50% and 61.8% ratios could be on the cards for the foreseeable future.''As for the daily chart, the analysis noted ''the price imbalance on the daily chart leaves the aforementioned weekly ratios on the Fibonacci scale exposed towards 1.0770 and 1.0936.''The price is moving in on the aforementioned weekly supply zone and prior daily swing lows:However, at this juncture, the weekly W-formation should be noted:This is a reversion pattern and the price would be expected to revisit the neckline in due course. In the meantime, the daily impulse could be due for a meanwhile correction also:The bearish head and shoulders are a topping pattern that currently features in the 15-min time frame. A break of the neckline near 1.0725 could spell trouble for the committed bulls. A break of 1.0705 will likely open the way for further supply to mitigate the price imbalance towards a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the daily bullish breakout impulse near 1.0665 that guards a 50% mean reversion to 1.0640. ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,GBP/USD Price Analysis: Faces a wall of resistance around 1.2600 and retraces towards 1.2530s,"The British pound shifted to the defensive as sentiment shifted sour and weighed by weaker than expected UK PMIs, which dragged the major from weekly highs at around 1.2600 towards the 1.2530s area. At 1.2536, the GBP/USD is trimming some of Monday’s gains and is down 0.40%.The mood remains dampened, spurred by concerns about the US economy falling into a recession. The Federal Reserve is on a hiking cycle, tightening its monetary policy, which according to money market futures, would see the Fed hiking towards the 2.75-3% area by the end of the year.Another factor that is weighing on is China’s Covid-19 crisis. Reports over the weekend illustrated that Beijing is struggling to cap the spread. Meanwhile, Shanghai, which was about to lift restrictions, witnessed another outbreak, though not as at the beginning of the last episode.Elsewhere, the GBP/USD opened near the daily high around 1.2600 but fell and broke below the central and S1 daily pivot points, near the 1.2480s. Nevertheless, towards the end of the European session, the major is treading water and is aiming towards the 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) at 1.2542.From a technical perspective, the GBP/USD remains downward biased, despite bouncing 300 pips from the YTD low to current levels. The 1.2600 mark probes to be a solid resistance, as the GBP/USD bulls struggled twice to reclaim the figure, which would have opened the door for an upward move towards the May 4 swing high at 1.2638. However, a daily close below 1.2600 would leave the pair vulnerable to additional selling pressure, further validated by the RSI at 48.69, within the negative territory and aiming lower.That said, the GBP/USD first support would be the psychological 1.2500 figure. A breach of the latter would expose July 2020 lows near 1.2479, followed by the May 17 daily low at 1.2313 and the YTD low at 1.2155.  ",fxstreet

""New geopolitical, financial, or supply-side shocks could tip the world economy into recession.""Meanwhile, with central banks in the picture, the US dollar's appeal has been hit due to other central bankers speaking out and carrying hawkish rhetoric.  The DXY index, which measures a basket of currencies vs. the US dollar printed a fresh one-month low on Tuesday after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said eurozone interest rates will likely be in positive territory by the end of the third quarter. This supported the euro in a correction higher and weighed on the greenback. As for the Reserve Bank of Australia, consumer spending seems to have held up well to the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) first hike in interest rates earlier this month. However, some of the data of late may not have met the mark. ''The Wage Price Index (WPI) came in below expectations in the first quarter at a low 0.7% QoQ (0.65%), the same rate as in the fourth quarter 2021,'' analysts at ANZ Bank explained, adding that ''this suggests the RBA is likely to hike the cash rate another 25bp in June, rather than a larger 40 or 50bp hike.''''The wage and employment data hasn’t, in our view, met Governor Lowe’s threshold of there needing to be “a very strong argument” for the RBA to “deviate” from moves of 25bp in coming months.''''Especially when the minutes from the May meeting highlighted that the Board meets monthly, so has the opportunity to review the setting of interest rates again within a relatively short period of time.''Meanwhile, markets are priced for quarter-point rises in the 0.35% cash rate in both June and July, and a half-point hike in August following what is likely to be another alarming inflation report.Looking ahead, the RBA Assistant Governor Luci Ellis is due to speak and could expand on the central bank's own outlook for policy.  ",fxstreet

The Dow Jones is falling 0.83% and the Nasdaq drops by 2.78%. The US 10-year yield stands at 2.73%, a four-week low while the 30-year is back under 3%.Economic data from the US came in below expectations (PMIs and New Home Sales) and weighed on the greenback.

A pick-up in China growth could be one potential trigger. The upward impact on global yields, commodity prices and a potential stabilization for global equity markets should encourage a higher USD/JPY even if the USD weakens more broadly. Yen weakness would be more evident though against high beta commodity currencies.”If the USD/JPY extends the decline, below the 126.30 support line, 126.00 is the next target followed by 125.75 (April 11, 12 high).

They point out the scale of the sell-off of the dollar does highlight the limits to the bull-run from here and with so much Federal Reserve tightening priced, they still expect the US dollar to weaken more notably later in the year.“We are sticking to our neutral bias for EUR/USD in the month ahead. The ECB’s recent hawkish policy shift has helped to provide some much-needed support for the EUR after it briefly tested and held support from the low in early 2017 at 1.0340. The EUR has since staged a relief rally moving back into the middle of our forecast range. The turnaround for the EUR has been reinforced by hawkish comments from President Lagarde signalling clearly that the ECB plans to speed up the pace of policy tightening in response to upside inflation risks.”“The removal of negative rate policy should provide more support for the EUR going forward given that it has proved effective at helping to keep the EUR weak by encouraging record capital outflows into foreign bond markets while it has been in place. It was more normal for EUR/USD to trade above the 1.2000-level in the decade prior to the introduction of negative rates.”“The EUR’s ability to extend its recent advance much further on the back of the normalization of ECB policy remains constrained by ongoing downside risks from the Ukraine conflict. It appears increasingly likely now that the conflict will prove more prolonged than initially hoped and thereby increases the risk of a longer period of disruption for the euro-zone economy that will both dampen growth and keep inflation higher for longer.”",fxstreet

The EU Manufacturing and Services PMI missed expectations, though downtick minimally. The German Manufacturing PMI beat expectations, carrying on the support from Monday’s German IFO readings, which showed the resilience of businesses and consumers.Further ECB speaking crossed the wires on Tuesday. ECB’s President Lagarde said, “I don’t think that we’re in a situation of surging demand at the moment. It’s definitely an inflation that is fueled by the supply side of the economy. In that situation, we have to move in the right direction, obviously, but we don’t have to rush and we don’t have to panic.” In the meantime, ECB’s Francois Villeroy added that “A 50 bp hike is not part of the consensus at this point, I am clear. Interest rate hikes will be gradual.”Albeit Lagarde and Villeroy’s efforts to push back, additional ECB “hawks” crossed wires. ECB’s Holzmann said a 50 bps hike in July would be appropriate. Furthermore, ECB’s Kazakhs added to that list and commented that the central bank should not rule out 50 bps rate rises and look for hikes in July and September, and possibly another in Q4.In the week ahead, the EU docket is packed and will feature German Gfk Consumer Confidence, German GDP, and France’s Consumer Confidence. On the US front, Durable Goods Orders, May’s FOMC Minutes, US GDP Growth Estimates, and the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE).The EUR/USD remains downward biased, despite the last couple of weeks’ price action, which formed a bottom after dropping from 2021 tops at around 1.2349. Nevertheless, the shared currency is still hovering around the April 2020 lows near 1.0727, which means that a daily close above the previously mentioned would open the door for further gains. Otherwise, the EUR/USD rally to the 1.0720s area would be seen as an opportunity for EUR/USD bears to add to their positions and aim for a re-test of the YTD lows at 1.0348.Upwards, the EUR/USD’s first resistance would be the 50-day moving average (DMA) at 1.0767. Break above would expose the March 7 daily low at 1.0805, followed by the 1.0900 mark. On the flip side, the major’s first support would be 1.0700. A breach of the latter would expose April 2017 daily low at 1.0635, followed by the 20-DMA at 1.0535.  ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,"GBP/JPY slumps from above 160 to low 158s, dragged lower as UK/US yields tumble post poor-UK/US PMI data","UK government bond yields had already been on the back foot in the lead up to the start of the US trading session in wake of much weaker than expected UK PMI data for May released earlier in the day which triggered renewed fears about the UK’s increasingly fragile, inflation plagued economy, but that move lower accelerated in tandem with a drop in global yields after disappointing US Service PMI numbers, which triggered fears about a slowdown in the world’s most important/largest economy.UK 10-year yields were last trading lower by more than 10 bps on the day, with similar drops seen in the US and, to a lesser extent owing to hawkish ECB commentary, the Eurozone. As a result, UK (and global)/Japan yields differentials have narrowed significantly on the day, weighing heavily on G10/JPY pairs owing to the yen’s sensitivity to rate differentials.GBP/JPY was last trading close to one-week lows under the 158.50 mark, down about 1.6% or over 250 pips on the day and eyeing a break lower towards monthly lows in the 156.00 area. Technicians will note how the 21-Day Moving Average (at 160.40) has once again proven a solid level of resistance, as has been the case since late April. As global growth fears largely subsume fears about central bank tightening, thus sending yields lower, G10/JPY pairs like GBP/JPY remain at risk of further losses. Traders will likely be targetting a test of the 200DMA in the mid-155.00s in the coming weeks.  ",fxstreet

7,2022-05-24,"NZD/USD stabilises near 0.6450 pre-RBNZ as markets digest weak NZ Retail Sales, soft US Service PMI data","Softer than expected Q1 New Zealand Retail Sales growth figures have contributed to a weakening of the kiwi on Tuesday, with NZD/USD eroding much of the gains it made on Monday as a result. Worries about global growth as scores of major institutions revised down their growth estimates for the Chinese economy and more US companies warned about a worsening economic environment also weighed. The pair is currently trading near the 0.6450 level, down about 0.3% on the day, after reaching as high as 0.6490 at the start of the week. Just released US Services PMI data for May was worse-than-expected and has helped the kiwi pare some of its intra-day losses versus the buck, with NZD/USD having been as low as the 0.6420s earlier in the day.Back to the New Zealand data; real Retail Sales growth came in at -0.5% QoQ in the first quarter of this year, below expectations for a solid pace of increase. Analysts at Westpac said the data “signals downside risk to our forecasts for a 0.6% rise in March quarter GDP”. “The rise in consumer prices is squeezing households' spending power,” they added, “while the rise in mortgage rates and related debt servicing costs will add to the pressures on discretionary incomes”.Still, the RBNZ is nonetheless expected to press ahead with a 50 bps rate hike during the upcoming Wednesday Asia Pacific session. Kiwi traders will be closely scrutinising the bank’s guidance for future rate hikes and NZD could be choppy as a result. Ahead of the upcoming RBNZ announcement, NZD/USD traders will also have to keep an eye on commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell from 16:20 GMT, where he will likely reiterate the bank’s stance that it is ready to lift interest rates above neutral without hesitation if needed to tame inflation.  ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,US: New Home Sales slump by 16.6% in April after dropping 10.5% in March,"New Home Sales in the US in April slumped 16.6% MoM, according to the latest data from the US Census Bureau released on Tuesday. That comes after a 10.5% slump in March, reflecting the ongoing impact of the recent sharp rise in mortgage rates. New Homes Sales came in at 591K over the past 12 months to April, well below expectations for 750K and down from March's 709K.  FX markets do not seem to have reacted to the latest US housing figures, concerning for the US economy though they were. Focus instead has seemingly remained on weak US Service PMI data released a few minutes before, which knocked the DXY back to session lows. ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,"USD/CHF breaks below 0.9600 mark, hits fresh monthly low amid risk-off/weaker USD","The USD/CHF pair dropped to a nearly one-month low during the early North American session and is now looking to extend the downward trajectory below the 0.9600 round-figure mark.The pair prolonged its recent sharp retracement slide from a two-year peak, around the 1.0065 region touched earlier this month and witnessed some follow-through selling on Tuesday. This marked the second successive day of a downfall - also the fifth in the previous six - and was sponsored by a combination of factors.The worsening global economic outlook continued weighing on investors' sentiment, which was evident from a fresh wave of the risk-aversion trade. This, in turn, boosted demand for the traditional safe-haven Swiss franc and dragged the USD/CHF pair lower amid the emergence of heavy selling around the US dollar.The anti-risk flow was reinforced by a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields. Apart from this, strong pickup in the shared currency - bolstered by hawkish comments by the ECB policymakers - dragged the USD Index to a fresh monthly low. This was seen as another factor that contributed to the USD/CHF pair's decline.On the economic data front, the US PMIs indicated a deceleration of growth in both - the manufacturing and services sector - and did little to provide any respite to the USD bulls. Tuesday's US economic docket also features New Home Sales and Richmond Manufacturing Index, though the focus remains on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech.  ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,USD/TRY in 2022 highs: Bulls remain well in charge in May,"Further weakness in the Turkish currency lifts USD/TRY to new YTD highs past the 16.00 barrier on Tuesday.USD/TRY advances for the third session in a row and finally manages to leave behind the 16.00 hurdle on Tuesday despite the persistent offered stance in the greenback.The lira, in the meantime, continues to suffer the omnipresent geopolitical tensions stemming from the war in Ukraine and its associated energy crisis, while rising speculation of a global slowdown seems to have already started to weigh on the currency.In addition, inflation concerns appear unabated and were particularly exacerbated after the monthly survey by the Turkish central bank (CBRT) on Monday now sees inflation around 58% by year end.Investors’ attention, in the meantime, slowly shifts to the CBRT’s event on Thursday and whether the bank will finally start hiking rates to tame the rampant inflation.USD/TRY keeps the upside bias well and sound and trades beyond the 16.00 yardstick for the first time since late December 2021.So far, price action in the Turkish currency is expected to gyrate around the performance of energy prices, the broad risk appetite trends, the Fed’s rate path and the developments from the war in Ukraine.Extra risks facing TRY also come from the domestic backyard, as inflation gives no signs of abating, real interest rates remain entrenched in negative figures and the political pressure to keep the CBRT biased towards low interest rates remain omnipresent.Key events in Turkey this week: Economic Confidence Index, CBRT Interest Rate Decision (Thursday).Eminent issues on the back boiler: FX intervention by the CBRT. Progress (or lack of it) of the government’s new scheme oriented to support the lira via protected time deposits. Constant government pressure on the CBRT vs. bank’s credibility/independence. Bouts of geopolitical concerns. Structural reforms. Upcoming Presidential/Parliamentary elections.So far, the pair is gaining 0.80% at 16.0484 and is expected to meet the next hurdle at 16.1533 (2022 high May 24) seconded by 18.2582 (all-time high December 20) and then 19.00 (round level). On the other and, a breach of 14.6836 (monthly low May 4) would expose 14.5458 (monthly low April 12) and finally 14.5136 (weekly low March 29).",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,"Commodities go back to the 70s, repeating the same stagflation trade – Deutsche Bank","How should investors position for stagflation? Economists at Deutsche Bank can already see similar patterns between how different assets performed in the 1970s and how they have been doing today. Commodities are the only asset class to see relatively consistent gains.“The main takeaway should be that if inflation stays high for many years, then both history and today's high starting valuations suggest it will be very difficult to generate positive real returns in most traditional financial asset classes. Nominal returns will also likely underperform their long-term trend.” “Commodities could be the exception although the run-up in prices in the last few quarters leaves the asset class much more expensive than it was.”“Traditional assets will need inflation to return back towards target in order to get back to long-term positive real returns. If not, then prepare for a decade of real wealth destruction after four decades of huge real wealth accumulation.” ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,US: Markit Manufacturing PMI falls to 57.5 in May (flash estimate) versus expected 57.5,"The flash estimate for May of IHS Markit's headline US Manufacturing PMI came in at 57.5, in line with expectations, data released on Tuesday showed. That was a slight decline from 59.2 last month. However, the flash estimate for May of IHS Markit's headline US Services PMI came in at 53.5, below expectations for a reading of 55.2 and below last month's 55.6. That meant that the flash estimate of IHS Markit's US Composite PMI fell to 53.8 in May from 55.6 in April. The US dollar has been under selling pressure in recent trade in wake of the downbeat US Service PMI numbers, which come at a time when recent earnings announcements (from Snap Inc. on Tuesday but also lots of big US retailers last week) have been warning about a worsening consumer environment. The DXY recently fell to fresh session lows under the 101.75 level, and is now down about 0.4% on the day. ",fxstreet
7,2022-05-24,"GBP/USD tumbles back below 1.2500 as weak UK PMIs reignite UK growth fears, amid risk-off flows","The sterling bears regained control on Tuesday and pushed GBP/USD back below the 1.2500 level, a roughly 100 pip turnaround from earlier session highs just shy of the 1.2600 level after UK PMI data released earlier in the day reignited fears about a possible recession later this year. The flash estimate of May’s headline Services PMI fell to 51.8, well below the expected drop to 56.9 from 58.9 in April. A reading below 50 suggests negative growth.The latest data has been interpreted as dampening the prospect for further BoE monetary tightening, given that bank had already been worried about UK growth as the country experiences its worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. The PMI data comes on the heels of last week’s UK Consumer Price Inflation reading that showed headline prices pressures rising at a four-decade high pace of 9.0% YoY in April and jobs data that showed the UK labour market remains tight at the start of Q2/end of Q1.In wake of aftermarket earnings on Monday from Snap that alluded to a weakening macro environment, which comes on the heels of big US retailers last week essentially pointing to the same thing, risk appetite has soured a little on Tuesday, with this also weighing on GBP/USD. As focus turns to the upcoming release of US PMI data at 1345GMT and then a speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 1620GMT, GBP/USD bears are eyeing a retest of the 21-Day Moving Average, which currently resides close to 1.2425.  ",fxstreet
8,2022-05-24,AUD/USD Price Analysis: Stays in the red near 0.7075-80 but holds above 23.6% Fibo.,"The AUD/USD pair came under some selling pressure on Tuesday and moved further away from over a two-week high, around the 0.7125 region touched the previous day. The pair remained depressed through the early North American session and was last seen trading around the 0.7075-0.7080 region, just a few pips above the daily low.The worsening global economic outlook continued weighing on investors' sentiment and triggered a fresh wave of the risk-aversion trade. This was evident from a generally weaker tone around the equity markets, which, in turn, undermined the perceived riskier aussie, though modest US dollar weakness helped limit deeper losses.From a technical perspective, the AUD/USD pair, so far, has managed to hold its neck above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the 0.6829-0.7128 recent recovery move. This is closely followed by a confluence comprising an upward sloping trend-line extending from the YTD low touched earlier this month and 100-hour SMA.The technical set-up warrants some caution before confirming that the recent positive move witnessed over the past two weeks or so has run out of steam and before placing bearish bets. Moreover, neutral oscillators on hourly/daily charts haven't been supportive of any firm near-term direction, warranting caution for aggressive traders.Hence, sustained weakness below the aforementioned confluence, around mid-0.7000s, is needed to support prospects for any further losses. The AUD/USD pair might then accelerate the slide towards the 38.2% Fibo. level, around the 0.7015 region, en-route the 0.7000 psychological mark and the 50% Fibo. level support near the 0.6980 area.On the flip side, the 0.7100 round-figure mark now seems to act as an immediate hurdle ahead of the overnight swing high, around the 0.7125 region. Some follow-through buying would be seen as a fresh trigger for bulls and pave the way for a move towards the 0.7200 round figure, with some intermediate resistance near the 0.7170 region.  ",fxstreet

As economists at TD Securities note, gold traders are increasingly questioning the Fed's willingness to hike into a recession.“Upside flow from CTAs along with renewed growth in ETFs have supported the recovery. In turn, the improving momentum has seen the nearest trigger within trend following models flip toward further upside should prices break north of $1,900/oz, rather than a whipsaw lower.“The recovery in the yellow metal is still on shaky ground as Fed Chair Powell signalled a willingness to sacrifice some economic growth in an effort to tame inflation, suggesting the Fed is comfortable with more pain before taking the foot off the brake, which should ultimately still weigh on precious metals.” ",fxstreet

That said, the next up barrier now appears at the 55-day SMA, today at 1.0785 before the 3-month resistance line around 1.0840.The breakout of this area should mitigate the selling pressure and allow for a probable move to the weekly high at 1.0936 (April 21).The daily RSI around 55 also indicates that extra upside could still be in store for the pair until it reaches the overbought territory (>70).  ",fxstreet
8,2022-05-24,"USD/JPY struggles near monthly low, bears await sustained break below 127.00 mark","The USD/JPY pair maintained its offered tone through the early North American session, albeit has managed to rebound a few pips from the daily low. The pair was last seen trading around the 127.40-127.35 region, still down over 0.40% for the day.The worsening global economic outlook continued weighing on investors' sentiment and triggered a fresh wave of the risk-aversion trade. This, in turn, boosted demand for traditional safe-haven currencies, including the Japanese yen, and exerted downward pressure on the USD/JPY pair. The anti-risk flow was reinforced by a fresh leg down in the US Treasury bond yields, which further inspired bearish traders and dragged spot prices back closer to the monthly low.The downside, however, remains cushioned, at least for the time being, amid the emergence of some US dollar buying at lower levels. Apart from this, a big divergence in the monetary policy stance adopted by the Bank of Japan (dovish) and the Fed (hawkish) assisted the USD/JPY pair to find some support ahead of the 127.00 round-figure mark. This, in turn, makes it prudent to wait for strong follow-through selling before positioning for any further depreciating move.Market participants now look forward to the US economic docket - featuring the releases of the flash PMI prints for May, New Home Sales and Richmond Manufacturing Index. This, along with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech and the US bond yields, will influence the USD price dynamics and provide some impetus to the USD/JPY pair.

8,2022-05-24,"Gold Price Analysis: XAU/USD remains underpinned near $1860 as buck, equities falter, yields remain subdued","Spot gold (XAU/USD) is unsurprisingly trading with an upside bias just above its 21-Day Moving Average at $1856.70 and near the $1860 mark amid a favourable macro backdrop that sees long-term US yields hovering close to monthly lows, US equities reversing Monday’s gains in pre-market trade and the DXY falling to fresh four-week lows under 102. The precious metal was last trading with gains of about 0.2%, boosted amid safe-haven flows from equities, by falling yields lowering the “opportunity cost” of holding non-yielding assets like gold, and as a the weaker US dollar makes the purchase of USD-denominated commodities like gold cheaper for international buyers, thus boosting its demand.Focus turns to upcoming US flash PMI survey data for May scheduled for release at 1345GMT, as investors fret about the strength of the US economy. Recent indications from major US companies (most recently Snap’s guidance on Monday, but before that from major retailers last week) is that conditions are worsening, though other indicators haven't been quite so downbeat. Tuesday’s PMIs are expected to fall in the latter camp, but traders should monitor the data in case it triggers any cross-asset volatility.Thereafter, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver some pre-recorded remarks at an event from 1620GMT. There is much less confusion/uncertainty about the Fed than there is about the current strength of the US economy. They are unequivocally hawkish, with Powell last week reiterating the bank’s desire to get rates to neutral by the end of the year (meaning a few more 50 bps hikes at upcoming meetings) and saying the bank wouldn’t hesitate to raise rates beyond neutral if needed to tame inflation, which remains far too high. Other Fed policymakers have all been reading off of the same script and the takeaway is clear, interest rates are moving higher.The big question for markets is just how much higher. Gold traders should beware that while the US dollar’s recent pullback from multi-decade highs printed earlier in the month has given the precious metal some short-term respite (its currently more than $50 higher versus earlier monthly lows), this may prove short-lived if inflation fails to moderate as fast as the Fed wants in the coming months, and if markets subsequently start betting on a higher Fed terminal rate. This would push long-term yields and the US dollar higher, which would make a return to sub-$1800 levels likely.  ",fxstreet
8,2022-05-24,"EUR/USD pushes above 1.0700 amid hawkish ECB vibes despite soft EZ PMIs, focus turns to US data/Fed’s Powell","Weaker than forecast Eurozone flash PMI survey data for May has not deterred euro bulls on Tuesday, given that it (unlike the UK data) still indicated solid underlying growth despite continued high inflationary pressures. Indeed, EUR/USD has been able to reclaim the 1.0700 level with the pair getting tailwinds from hawkish ECB commentary thus far on the week. At current levels between 1.0710-20, the pair is trading with gains of about 0.25% on the day, taking its gains on the week to around 1.5%.To recap, in a Monday blog post, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the ECB would likely lift interest rates into positive territory by the end of Q3, a stance she reiterated in remarks made earlier this Tuesday. Other important ECB players have thrown support behind this shift in stance, including Bank of France head Francois Villeroy de Galhau, though a few of the ECB’s more hawkish members have been reportedly irked by the fact that Lagarde and other “core” ECB members have taken a 50 bps rate rise off of the table. Austria’s Robert Holzmann was, on Tuesday, pushing for a 50 bps hike in July.Even if the hawks aren’t satisfied, the euro bulls seem to be. EUR/USD is nearly 3.5% higher versus lows printed earlier in the month in the mid-1.0300s, defying (for now) calls by some analysts for EUR/USD to hit parity in the weeks/months ahead. The recent upturn in the pair also comes despite continued ropey sentiment in the global equity space, which would normally be a headwind given likely USD safe-haven flows.EUR/USD is now eyeing a test of its 50-Day Moving Average in the 1.0760s and strategists are unsurprisingly questioning how much further the rebound has to run. The major driver of USD gains thus far this year has been the hawkish shift from the Fed and commentary from policymakers last week suggested that they are only getting more hawkish. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is slated to speak at 16:20 GMT on Tuesday and will likely reiterate the bank’s stance that it is ready to lift interest rates above neutral without hesitation if needed to tame inflation.That is a far more hawkish stance than that of the ECB and, as a result, FX strategists suspect it won’t be long before the USD bulls return to buy the dip, which likely caps the prospect of a prolonged EUR/USD rebound. Focus will also be on the upcoming release of US flash PMI survey data for May at 13:45 GMT, which should show growth in the US remains solid and inflationary pressures high.  ",fxstreet
8,2022-05-24,"USD/CAD pares intraday gains, back below 1.2800 mark amid weaker USD/uptick in oil prices","The USD/CAD pair struggled to capitalize on its goodish bounce from a near three-week low set earlier this Tuesday and was seen trading below the 1.2800 mark heading into the North American session.The impending European Union ban on Russian oil imports continued fueling concerns about tightening global supply. Adding to this, hopes for demand recovery in China assisted crude oil prices to reverse modest intraday losses. This, in turn, underpinned the commodity-linked loonie and acted as a headwind for the USD/CAD pair amid the emergence of fresh selling around the US dollar.In fact, the key USD Index dropped to a nearly one-month low amid strong pickup in the shared currency, which gained traction in reaction to hawkish comments by the European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers. That said, the prevalent risk-off environment - amid the worsening global economic outlook - helped limit losses for the safe-haven buck and extended some support to the USD/CAD pair.Investors remain worried that a more aggressive move by major central banks to curb soaring inflation could pose challenges to the global economy. Adding to this, the Russia-Ukraine war and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China have been fueling recession fears. This, in turn, kept a lid on the overnight optimistic move in the markets and benefitted traditional safe-haven assets.Apart from this, expectations that the US central bank would need to take more drastic action to bring inflation under control held back traders from placing aggressive USD bearish bets. Hence, the focus will remain glued to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech later during the early North American session and the latest FOMC meeting minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday.A 50 bps Fed rate hike move over the next two meetings is already priced in, suggesting that market participants will look for clues about the possibility of a jumbo 75 bps rate hike in June. This, in turn, will play a key role in driving the USD demand in the near term and assist traders to determine the next leg of a directional move for the USD/CAD pair.In the meantime, traders will take cues from the US economic docket - featuring the releases of the flash PMI prints for May, New Home Sales and Richmond Manufacturing Index. This, along with the broader market risk sentiment, will drive the USD demand. Apart from this, oil price dynamics should allow traders to grab short-term opportunities around the USD/CAD pair.  ",fxstreet

8,2022-05-24,"Silver Price Analysis: XAG/USD bears have the upper hand, rising wedge breakdown in play","Silver attracted some dip-buying near the $21.65 area on Tuesday and refreshed its daily high during the first half of the European session. Bulls, however, struggled to capitalize on the move and spot prices remained below the $22.00 mark, warranting caution before positioning for any further gains.From a technical perspective, the overnight rejection slide from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the $23.28-$20.46 downfall dragged the XAG/USD below an ascending trend line. This, along with another upward sloping trend line, constituted the formation of a bearish rising wedge pattern.The aforementioned support breakpoint coincided with the 100-period SMA on the 4-hour chart and the 50% Fibo. level, which now seemed to cap the upside for the XAG/USD. Meanwhile, oscillators on the daily chart are holding in negative territory but are yet to confirm a bearish bias on hourly charts.Nevertheless, the technical set-up favours bearish traders and supports prospects for further losses. The XAG/USD seems vulnerable to sliding back to test the 38.2% Fibo. level, around mid-$21.00s, before eventually dropping to the $21.30 area en-route the 23.6% Fibo. level, around the $21.10 region.Some follow-through selling would expose the YTD low, around the $20.45 zone touched earlier this month. The downward trajectory could further get extended and allow bearish traders to challenge the $20.00 psychological mark.On the flip side, momentum back above the $22.00 round figure might continue to confront stiff resistance near the $22.25 confluence. The said barrier represents 61.8% Fibo. level and the top boundary of the rising wedge, which if cleared decisively will negate any near-term negative bias.  ",fxstreet

8,2022-05-24,Singapore: Did inflation peak in April? – UOB,"Barnabas Gan, Economist at UOB Group, comments on the results of inflation figures in Singapore.“Singapore’s consumer prices rose 5.4% y/y (-0.1% m/m nsa) in Apr 2022, marking the first month-on-month contraction in 9 months. The rate of increase is also markedly lower compared to market expectations for a 5.7% y/y (+0.2% m/m sa) climb. Core inflation however accelerated to 3.3% y/y in the same month, from 2.9% in Mar 2022.”“Notwithstanding the inflation risks seen at this juncture, the climb in headline CPI at 5.4% y/y was significantly overshadowed by the pace of increase in global commodity prices. This suggests the effectiveness of Singapore’s monetary policy, whereby the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has lifted the S$NEER gradient in the last three policy statements.”“Inflation risks remain magnified on the back of higher global commodity prices. We keep our headline and core inflation forecasts to average 4.5% and 3.5% in 2022 respectively. This is in line with the official outlook for both headline (4.5 – 5.5%) and core inflation (2.5% - 3.5%) for this year. We also expect MAS to further steepen the S$NEER gradient slightly in its upcoming Oct policy statement, while leaving the width of the band and the level at which it is centred unchanged.”",fxstreet

The worsening global economic outlook triggered a fresh wave of the risk-aversion trade and boosted demand for the safe-haven Japanese yen. Apart from this, the disappointing release of the UK PMI prints prompted aggressive selling around the British pound and exerted additional downward pressure on the cross.In fact, the Preliminary UK Services PMI showed a sharp deceleration of growth in May and slumped to a 15-month low level of 51.8 versus April’s final readout of 58.9 and 57.3 expected. Adding to this, the seasonally adjusted S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.6 in May versus 55.1 expected and April’s final reading of 55.8. The data reaffirmed the Bank of England's gloomy economic outlook and forced investors to scale back bets for any further rate hikes in the near future.This, along with the UK-EU impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol, weighed heavily on sterling and was seen as a key factor behind the latest leg of a steep decline witnessed over the past hour or so. The GBP/JPY cross plunged to multi-day low and took along some shor-term trading stops placed near the 159.00 round-figure mark. Moreover, acceptance below the 200-hour SMA supports prospects for additional losses and a slide towards testing the next relevant support near the 158.00 mark.  ",fxstreet

In case these data highlight the diverging US-UK economic outlook, GBP/USD could extend its slide.”“The ascending trend line coming from mid-May stays intact despite the latest decline and forms significant support at 1.25.

The news caused the euro to appreciate noticeably yesterday, pulling gold up to $1,865 for a time. However gold in euros is kept in check, economists at Commerzbank report.“Lagarde announced ‘a progressive further normalisation of interest rates towards the neutral rate’ for the period after the third quarter.”“Our ECB watcher believes that 1-1.5% would be considered a neutral rate by the ECB. We assume that the ECB will raise the deposit rate by 25 basis points at each of its seven meetings between July and next May, bringing the rate then to 1.25%. The market expects interest rates to increase to 1.0% by then.” “We believe that the euro could profit for a while from the prospect of a more restrictive ECB monetary policy, providing that the situation in Ukraine does not deteriorate significantly. This should support gold in US dollars but keep gold in euros in check.” ",fxstreet
9,2022-05-24,"Gold Price Forecast: XAUUSD clings to gains near $1,860 amid falling yields","Gold Price is heading back towards the highest levels in two weeks, as bulls continue to draw support from the falling US Treasury yields across the curve.Risk-aversion remains at full steam, accentuated by the weak Eurozone and the UK business PMIs, which drives the haven demand into the US government bond. This, in turn, weighs down on the Treasury yields, aiding the upside in the non-yielding gold.Moreover, the bright metal also capitalizes on a broadly subdued US dollar. The greenback came under renewed selling pressure after the EUR/USD pair rebounded sharply on the latest hawkish comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde. The dollar is keeping its corrective mode intact ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC May meeting’s minutes.Brewing geopolitical tensions between the US and China over Taiwan is also boding well for the traditional safe-haven gold. US President Joe Biden maintains its commitment of getting militarily involved to defend the self-governed island claimed by China. When asked if there had been any change to the policy after remarks on Monday, Biden said ""No.""Attention now turns towards US Manufacturing and Services PMIs due later in the NA session for fresh cues on risk sentiment and the dollar dynamics.Daily closing above the 21-DMA of $1,857 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal, exposing the additional upside towards the mildly bullish 100-DMA at $1,885.

9,2022-05-24,Breaking: GBP/USD plummets to sub-1.2500 levels amid doubts over further BoE rate hikes,"The GBP/USD pair continued with its struggle to make it through the 1.2600 round-figure mark and witnessed a dramatic turnaround during the early part of the European session on Tuesday. The steep intraday slide dragged spot prices back below the 1.2500 psychological mark, or a fresh daily low in the last hour.The latest leg of a sudden fall of over 100 pips followed the disappointing release of the UK Services PMI, which showed a sharp deceleration in growth during May. In fact, the Preliminary UK Services Business Activity Index slumped to a 15-month low and arrived at 51.8 versus April’s final readout of 58.9 and 57.3 expected.Adding to this, the seasonally adjusted S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI dropped to 54.6 in May versus 55.1 expected and April’s final reading of 55.8. The data reaffirmed the Bank of England's gloomy economic outlook and forced investors to scale back bets for any further rate hikes in the near future.This, along with the UK-EU impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol, weighed heavily on the British pound. Apart from this, the downfall could further be attributed to some cross-driven weakness stemming from a spike in the EUR/GBP cross that followed hawkish comments by the European Central Bank policymakers.With the latest leg down, the GBP/USD pair reversed the previous day's positive move to a near three-week high and also snapped a three-day winning streak. Some follow-through selling below mid-1.2400s will suggest that the recent bounce from the YTD low has run its course and set the stage for further near-term losses.  ",fxstreet

Hence, buyers might wait for the pair to correct its overbought conditions before adding to long euro positions.”“On the downside, 1.07 (psychological level, static level) aligns as first support. If buyers manage to defend this level, the pair could regain its traction and test 1.0740 (daily high, static level) before targeting 1.0780 (static level) and 1.0800 (psychological level).”“With a four-hour close below 1.07, EUR/USD could extend its correction toward 1.0670 (static level) and 1.0640 (200-period SMA).” ",fxstreet
9,2022-05-24,"EUR/GBP jumps to one-and-half-week high, around mid-0.8500s on hawkish ECB policymakers","The EUR/GBP cross built on the overnight solid rebound from the 0.8435-0.8430 zone, or the 200-day SMA and gained strong follow-through traction for the second straight day on Tuesday. The momentum extended through the early part of the European session and pushed spot prices to over a one-week high, around mid-0.8500s in the last hour.The shared currency's relative outperformance comes on the back of the overnight hawkish comments by the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, hinting at a probable rate hike in July. In a blog post, Lagarde said that the ECB was likely to lift the euro area deposit rate out of the negative territory by the end of September. She added that the central bank could raise interest rates further if it saw inflation stabilizing at 2%.Adding to this, ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that the central bank is in the process of normalising policy and that rate hikes in July and September are likely a done deal.  This, to a larger extent, helped offset mostly lower-than-expected Eurozone PMI prints for the month of May. Furthermore, the emergence of fresh selling around the US dollar remained supportive of the strong bid tone surrounding the euro.On the other hand, the British pound was undermined by the UK-EU impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol. In fact, the British government last week announced legislation that would effectively override parts of a Brexit deal, fueling fears about a trade war in the middle of the cost-of-living crisis. This, along with the disappointing release of the flash UK PMIs, weighed on sterling and provided an additional lift to the EUR/GBP cross.The fundamental backdrop now seems tilted in favour of bullish traders and supports prospects for additional gains. Hence, a subsequent move back towards reclaiming the 0.8600 mark, en-route the YTD peak around the 0.8615-0.8620 region, remains a distinct possibility.  ",fxstreet

This, in turn, was seen as a key factor that assisted the GBP/USD pair to attract some dip-buying near the mid-1.2500s, though the uptick lacked bullish conviction.The worsening global economic outlook continued weighing on investors' sentiment and triggered a fresh bout of global risk-aversion trade. This was evident from a sea of red across the equity markets, which should act as a tailwind for the safe-haven buck amid expectations that the Fed would need to take more drastic action to bring inflation under control.Apart from this, the UK-EU impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol should hold back traders from placing aggressive bullish bets around the British pound. Hence, it will be prudent to wait for strong follow-through buying before positioning for an extension of the recent strong recovery move from the YTD low, around the 1.2155 region touched earlier this month.Market participants now look forward to the release of PMI prints from the UK and the US, which will drive the market risk sentiment and influence the USD price dynamics.

That said, we did not quite expect USD to break both levels so quickly (USD dropped to 6.6480 before rebounding). Further USD weakness is not ruled out but deeply oversold shorter-term conditions could lead to a few days of consolidation first.
